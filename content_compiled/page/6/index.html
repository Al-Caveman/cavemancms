<p>You don't grow <em>beard</em>, nor that you shave <em>him</em>.  It's rather that <em>beard</em>
lets you grow under <em>him</em> as shown in  <a href="#cite_beardpic">Figure 1</a>.  Likewise, when you become
too decadent to deserve such honour, <em>beard</em> shaves you away as shown in
 <a href="#cite_trudeaupic">Figure 2</a> &mdash; <em>beard</em> is eternal.</p>

<h2 id="blindfolded_faggot_thought_experiment"><a class="hindex" href="#blindfolded_faggot_thought_experiment">2.</a> the blindfolded faggot thought
experiment</h2>

<p>This is a thought experiment to investigate what makes a faggot, a faggot.
Consider the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> <em>Group 1</em> &mdash; A blindfoldeded faggot is given a woman's butt, but the faggot
  is lied to that the butt is a man's.  He then f***s the butt, then rates
  it from 1 to 5 (1 is bad, 5 is good).
</li>
<li> <em>Group 2</em> &mdash; Same, but the faggot is told the truth that it's a female's
  butt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine that we randomly sample 100 faggots from Amsterdam's faggot pride
rally, and randomly assign 50 of them to <em>Group 1</em> and the other 50 to <em>Group
2</em> &mdash; what do you think will happen?</p>

<p>On average, <em>I bet</em> this will happen:</p>

<ul>
<li> Faggots of <em>Group 1</em> would say &ldquo;<em>OMG BEST MALE BUTT EVER 5/5!!</em>&rdquo;.</li>
<li> Faggots of <em>Group 2</em> would say &ldquo;<em>No.  0/5.  Can't even have an erection.  We
  are born faggots don't you know?</em>&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably agree.  Because, <em>I guess</em>, a male's anus is the same as a
female's.  Or, if you are too skeptic, you may at least agree that a female's
anus is like, say, a 10 years old boy's anus<sup><a href="#fn___6">1</a></sup>?  This probably also explains
why faggots are often crypto pedos.</p>

<p>Here is what I think the thought experiment implies:</p>

<ol>
<li> Technically, <em>in the thought experiment</em>, the faggot is fucking the anus, not
  the butt, not the legs, not the face with shaved beard, etc.</li>
<li> The reason a faggot appreciates an anus that's attached to a man's butt, over
  another that's attached to a female's butt, is because of the <em>context</em>
  around the anus.  E.g. man's anus has the context that it is attached to a
  hairy man's ass that's attached to a face with shaved beard.</li>
<li> Such context information is a very high-level information.</li>
<li> High-level context-information is IMO processed by the brain.</li>
<li> IMO neural activity about context information is by far mostly influenced by
  the past memory, or environment, than (say) genes.</li>
<li> Therefore, the primary contributor in the making of a faggot is the
  environment, and not the genes (genes might be only a marginal/secondary
  cause).</li>
</ol>
<p id="cite_faggotenv"><strong><a href="#cite_faggotenv">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>Environment is the main factor in the making of a faggot.</em></p>

<hr/>
<ul style="list-style:none;padding:0; margin:0;"><li id="fn___6"><small>1. I'm just guessing.  I never tried
any.  IMO it's easy to simulate anuses given their simplicity since they are
merely some elastic holes.  IMO You don't need to actually put your junk in
anuses to discover that they are elastic holes.</small></li>

<h2 id="imo_music_not_good"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good">3.</a> imo music is not good</h2>

<p>Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:</p>

<ul>
<li> That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.  Now the next question is:</p>

<p id="cite_whyneedmusic"><strong><a href="#cite_whyneedmusic">Question 1.</a></strong> <em>Why do you need that information?</em></p>

<p>and its answer:</p>

<p id="cite_studyingretards"><strong><a href="#cite_studyingretards">Answer 1.</a></strong> <em>Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.</em></p>

<p>So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!</p>

<p>Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:</p>

<ul>
<li> Weakens your ear drums.</li>
<li> Induces bias to your brain's activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <em>drums</em> damage point, evolution-wise, we are more evolved to handle
sounds found in nature, as opposed to sounds produced by musical instruments.
This may explain why music is more harmful to our ears than natural sounds.</p>

<p>But what do I mean by the <em>bias</em> shit?  Basically music IMO alters how you
think.  E.g. depending on the music you listen, you may end up being more
risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not good, because it induces some
artificial bias in your brain's function as shown in  <a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 3</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_biasvariance" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Some shooting targets showing the bias-variance trade-off." src="https://cave.mn/pics/bias-variance-tradeoff.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 3.</a></strong> Bias-variance trade-off.</figcaption></figure>

<p>IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.</p>

<h3 id="imo_music_not_good.1"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good.1">3.1.</a> criticism</h3>

<p>Some people disagree with me and say that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">music can make people
smarter</a>.  But IMO  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> has a fundamental flaw: the alternative
to music classes for kids were <em>drama lessons</em> and <em>nothing</em>.  They didn't
include, say, <em>mathematics</em> classes as an alternative.</p>

<p>This is why  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> is shit: maybe the reason the kids that learned
music became smarter was thanks to them needing to learn musical notes (those
fancy symbols for music) which functions as some kind of programming (except
for generating sound).</p>

<p>In other words, if the kids had taken a <em>programming</em> class, or extra
<em>mathematics</em> classes, then maybe they would have been even smarter, without
having the side effect of musical instruments possibly damaging their ears.</p>

<p>IMO it's disgusting that the study claims it's due to music that kids became
smarter, and not because of the abstract mathematical and logical aspects of
generating music, which &mdash;itself&mdash; is not music.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410500342542">This other study</a> says that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">that study</a> is shit, but then
adds its own shit by doing similar wrong shit.  One funny aspect it mentions
that music is good to calm retards.  See&hellip; I LITERALLY told you music is for
retards!</p>
