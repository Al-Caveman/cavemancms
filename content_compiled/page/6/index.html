<h2 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting">1.</a> thoughts on majority voting</h2>

<p>Majority voting &mdash;the backbone of democracy&mdash; has several flaws, but this is
what <em>really</em> bothers me:</p>

<p id="cite_majvotingsucks"><strong><a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1.</a></strong> <em><em>Ideally</em><sup><a href="#fn___4">1</a></sup>, when the voters are any from the entire
           population, the majority of voters are non-experts on the subject
           that they are voting on.</em></p>

<p>I think it's obvious why  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a> is probably true by looking at the
past.  E.g. British ppl who voted on Brexit were mostly non-experts in economy
nor politics.  So I think  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a> is a fair conjecture.</p>

<p> <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a> is very bothering, because it says that the best thing you
could get out of majority voting is some mediocre average <em>shit</em>.</p>

<h3 id="please"><a class="hindex" href="#please">1.1.</a> what's its goal?</h3>

<p>But if it's so bad, why do many govs use it?  Are they simply dumb and they
can't see what a <em>caveman</em> saw?  I doubt.  Are they smart, but there is another
motive behind majority-voting?  But if you have a peaceful population, then no
need for majority voting IMO.</p>

<p>IMO  <a href="#cite_majvotinggood">Conjecture 2</a> shows the only reason majority voting is appealing.  I.e.
it's a good method for reducing riots, which can eventually save <em>a lot</em> of
money if you have a badass population that may riot any time.</p>

<p id="cite_majvotinggood"><strong><a href="#cite_majvotinggood">Conjecture 2.</a></strong> <em>Majority voting guarantees that the majority of the population are
           happy about the decision.</em></p>

<h3 id="othergoal"><a class="hindex" href="#othergoal">1.2.</a> how about other goals?</h3>

<p>What if, instead of aiming to please most people (majority-voting's aim), our
goal was to rather find <em>the best</em> decision?  I don't think majority voting is
it (due to  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a>).  What I think is it<sup><a href="#fn___5">2</a></sup>, is the following method:</p>

<ol>
<li> Agree on the definition of what is <em>good</em>.  I suggest  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">this definition
   of good</a>.</li>
<li> Choose/perform the decision that has maximum expected <em>good</em>.</li>
<li> If someone wishes to change something, that someone would need to present
  evidence that his change is <em>more good</em> than the existing something.</li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn't matter if it's 1 person, or 1 billion people, who want the change.
What matters is only to present evidence that shows that a change is <em>more
good</em>.</p>

<p>But obviously, soon, we will end up seeing ppl abusing sources of evidence.
E.g. if statistics is the source, then we will see ppl generating false
statistics and claiming that they are legit, while they aren't.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.3"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.3">1.3.</a> what's happening in reality?</h3>

<p>IMO, in reality, in <em>nice</em> democratic countries, this is what's happening:</p>

<ol>
<li> Majority voting is used to calm idiots so they don't riot in streets.  They
  only elect a symbolic figure, like a president &mdash;
   <a href="#please">Section 1.1</a>.</li>
<li> The real decisions are actually done by experts in their domains (e.g. game
  theorists, logicians, statisticians, etc) behind closed doors &mdash;
   <a href="#othergoal">Section 1.2</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In <em>nice</em> dictatorship countries, this is what's happening:</p>

<ol>
<li> The real decisions are actually done by experts in their domains (e.g. game
  theorists, logicians, statisticians, etc) behind closed doors &mdash;
   <a href="#othergoal">Section 1.2</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, nice dictatorship is more efficient than nice democracy as the
former doesn't need to waste resources to run the votes.</p>

<p>Which is of course not a surprise that a nice dictatorship is better than a
nice democracy.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.4"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.4">1.4.</a> democracy vs. dictatorship</h3>

<p>Which approach is more likely to produce a nice system: Democracy? Or
dictatorship?  IMO <em>dictatorship</em>, because:</p>

<ul>
<li> Most 1st world countries seem to collect votes only to calm their population.
  E.g. Brexit.  So in practice hardly any one runs democracy any way (which is
  good, IMO).</li>
<li> Dictatorship is not <em>entirely</em> dictatorship.  It's rather <em>election by
  natural selection</em>, which IMO is <em>the ultimate form of voting</em>, which IMO
  directly rewards what is <em>good</em> as per  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">my definition of good</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, democracy is also bound by natural selection, which is why I think
it <em>mostly</em> got extinct in practice due to  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a>.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_majority_voting.5"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_majority_voting.5">1.5.</a> will voting always work?</h3>

<p>In  <a href="#please">Section 1.1</a> is said that majority voting is good to
calm people, and hence save money that would be otherwise spent on riot
control.  In this section I ask the question: <em>will it always work?</em></p>

<p>My answer: <em>IMO no</em>.  My justification:  at some point people will eventually
learn that it's a fake play to calm the majority.  At this point, it will no
longer be effective, as people will know that their voice are actually
<em>uheard</em>.</p>

<p>IMO, <em>voting</em> is either a bad idea (see  <a href="#cite_majvotingsucks">Conjecture 1</a>), or a lie to avoid
riots.  In the case of the former, it's getting extinct by natural selection.
In the case of the latter, IMO it goes under <em>lies don't sustain</em> like any
<em>win-lose</em> relationship.</p>

<h2 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete">2.</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative">categorical imperative</a> is obsolete</h2>

<p>I just wanna say that  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative">categorical imperative</a>:</p>

<p id="cite_thecategoricalimp"><strong><a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1.</a></strong> <em>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time,
      will that it should become a universal law.</em></p>

<p>is obsoleted by my superior alternative:</p>

<p id="cite_dogood"><strong><a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2.</a></strong> <em>Do what is  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">good</a> for humanity.</em></p>

<p><em>Why?</em> you may ask.  Bcoz <em>simpler</em> and <em>correcter</em>.  The <em>simpler</em> is maybe
easy to see, but why <em>correcter</em>?</p>

<h3 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete.1"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete.1">2.1.</a> suicide case</h3>

<p> <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a> is correcter than  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a> because former is much more
objective than the latter.  E.g. with  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a> a suicidal person may
say &ldquo;<em>Welp&hellip; I'm OK to be killed by others, therefore it is also OK for me to
kill others</em>&rdquo;.  This problem does not exist in  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a>.</p>

<p>But  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a> knew of that suicide issue and proposed a solution.  So  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#Suicide">he added a special case</a>
to handle the suicide.  IMO he is basically adding the exception &ldquo;<em>let's also
not get extinct!</em>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn___6">3</a></sup> &mdash; my
 <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a> handles this issue cleanly without needing to add any special case!</p>

<h3 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete.2"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete.2">2.2.</a> fancy facility case</h3>

<p>Here is another example beyond the suicide case earlier where my  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a>
trumps  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li> I want to build a massive research facility that will help humanity do some
  really advanced research to save humanity.</li>
<li> But this facility is soooOoOo big that there can be only one of its kind on
  Earth.  If any one else tried to build another facility of this kind, it will
  harm the functionality of the other.  It's some kind of advanced research.</li>
<li> This means I will want to build this good facility, yet at the same time not
  want anyone else to build a similar facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a>, it will be <em>immoral</em> of me if I created
that obviously good research facility!  IMO this shows a limitation in
 <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a>.</p>

<p>While my  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a> does not suffer from any of those exceptions.
As you see, my shit is simpler and better than  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s shit.</p>

<h3 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete.3"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete.3">2.3.</a> why didn't  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a> see  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a>?</h3>

<p>Maybe in part because he was from the 1700s, while evolution came later IMO
since  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</a> is an 1800s dude.  This matters because it relates to how I
define  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">good</a>.</p>

<h2 id="God_extends_optimization_scope"><a class="hindex" href="#God_extends_optimization_scope">3.</a> God extends our optimization scope</h2>

<p id="cite_very_long_term_proj_def"><strong><a href="#cite_very_long_term_proj_def">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>A project <span class="ignored">$p$</span> is said to be &ldquo;a very long-term project&rdquo; if, and only
           if, founder of <span class="ignored">$p$</span>, i.e. dude <span class="ignored">$x$</span>, knows that <span class="ignored">$p$</span> will be profitable
           only after <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s death.</em></p>

<p id="cite_god_extends_optimization_scope"><strong><a href="#cite_god_extends_optimization_scope">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>The probability of having person <span class="ignored">$x$</span> found a very long-term project is
        higher when person <span class="ignored">$x$</span> believes in a fair God, than the alternative
        case where <span class="ignored">$x$</span> doesn't.</em></p>

<h3 id="God_extends_optimization_scope.1"><a class="hindex" href="#God_extends_optimization_scope.1">3.1.</a>  <a href="#cite_god_extends_optimization_scope">Theorem 1</a>'s proof</h3>

<p>IMO if a person doesn't believe in God, then &mdash;logically speaking&mdash; his
<em>brain</em> has no reason to justify investing effort in any long-term project that
will only profit after person's death.  His <em>brain</em> will only accept investing
in projects that will be profitable during his lifespan.</p>

<p>The only way to get your <em>brain</em> to accept that investing in such long-term
projects is a good idea, is to have some kind of punishments/rewards system
that will apply to you after your death&mdash;AKA a fair God.</p>

<p>There you go:  on advantage of believing in a fair God is that it makes your
<em>brain</em> accept investing in long-term projects that would benefit humanity in
the long run, even though you might be alive to see that day.</p>

<p>The only way a Godless person can do that is by having his <em>feelings</em> push him
to care about past his death (but not his <em>brain</em>).  Worse, such <em>feelings</em>
would always face resistance from the <em>brain</em>.</p>

<p>But, a Godly person would have his <em>brain</em> and <em>feelings</em> in agreement about
investments in positive long-term projects that benefit humanity, because the
believe in the fair God implies a fair reward even after one's death.</p>

<p id="cite_godmightbereal"><strong><a href="#cite_godmightbereal">Note 1.</a></strong> <em>Even though this column discussed God from an atheist's perspective, it
     does not mean that God is unreal.  It just means that even an atheist
     should find a reason to appreciate believe in God&mdash;unless he is suicidal
     and doesn't care about humanity's survivability.</em></p>
