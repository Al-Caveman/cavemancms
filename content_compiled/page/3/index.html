<h2 id="God_extends_optimization_scope"><a class="hindex" href="#God_extends_optimization_scope">1.</a> God extends our optimization scope</h2>

<p>Imagine a person that does not believe in God, afterlife punishments, nor
rewards.  Why would such a person's <em>brain</em> conclude to invest in a project
that its outcomes would benefit people only after well after his death?  Why
shouldn't he, instead, spend his money to simpler projects where he will enjoy
the gains within his lifespan of, say, <span class="ignored">$80$</span> years?</p>

<p>If the person believes in no God or afterlife judgements, he will <em>always</em> be
in a conflict between his feelings and his brain: </p>

<ul>
<li> Depending on how lovely the person is, his feelings <em>may</em> push him to be nice
  to future humans in order to be remembered.</li>
<li> Regardless of how nice he is, his brain <em>will always</em> tell him that this is
  stupid and makes no sense.  The brain is also right.  There is no logical
  reason to invest your hard-earned money in something that you won't enjoy in
  your lifespan.  Why care about life after your death?</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO, the fact that this conflict exists in a Godless world, the expected number
of cases where an individual may act to perform actions that are useful for
humans in the long run, will decrease&mdash;let's call this: <em>increased expected
crab mentality rate</em>.</p>

<p>The increased crab mentality rate is obviously bad, because in the space of
possible actions that can maximize humanity's survivability, lies actions that
their gains can be manifested only in the very long run past the lifespan of a
single human.  Therefore it's a pity to live in a culture where humans have
reduced incentives to invest in such long-term projects.</p>

<p>IMO the solution is to believing in a fair God.  Only then the brain will find
reasons to justify investments in long-term projects that benefit humanity.
This way, both feelings and logical thinking are agreeing to help humanity
maximize its survivability; since a fair God would appreciate such good deeds.</p>

<p>Therefore, IMO, an honest atheist should at least appreciate that believe in
religions with <em>fair powerful Gods</em> is good, and that such religions exist
because of our brain's attempt to maximize its survivability as a specie.</p>

<p id="cite_godmightbereal"><strong><a href="#cite_godmightbereal">Note 2.</a></strong> <em>Even though this column discussed God from an atheist's perspective, it
     does not mean that God is unreal.  It just means that even an atheist
     should find a reason to appreciate believe in God&mdash;unless he is suicidal
     and doesn't care about humanity's survivability.</em></p>

<p>They mainly only had an I/O problem as they kept plugging output devices into
other output devices.</p>

<p>But they were pretty real people, in a sense that they didn't chop their balls
to make fake vags, nor that they wore pants with fake pockets, or shirts with
fake zippers.</p>

<p>Compared to today's standards<sup><a href="#fn___1">1</a></sup>, they were pretty
conservative faggots.  But, still,  <a href="#cite_sodompunish">Figure 1</a> happened to them.</p>

<h2 id="dukkha_workout_routine"><a class="hindex" href="#dukkha_workout_routine">3.</a> the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">Dukkha</a> routine</h2>

<p>I propose to you the <em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">Dukkha</a> routine</em> &mdash; a workout routine tailored
specifically for the needs of the modern man of the <span class="ignored">$21^{st}$</span> century.</p>

<h3 id="3.1"><a class="hindex" href="#3.1">3.1.</a> advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li> Can be done in many places as it requires very few tools.</li>
<li> Can be done by busy people as it requires only 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li> Covers most of your muscles, and leads proportional muscle growth.  In about
  a month of following this routine, my cold-flexed biceps got bigger by 1
  inch &mdash; This Shit Works&trade;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.2"><a class="hindex" href="#3.2">3.2.</a> resources needed</h3>

<ul>
<li> 1 dumbbell.</li>
<li> Something horizontal to hang on to do pull-ups.</li>
<li> 2 circular ropes to hang on the horizontal thing to do the suspension dips.</li>
<li> 10 to 15 minutes max.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.3"><a class="hindex" href="#3.3">3.3.</a> the routine</h3>

<ul>
<li> Pull-ups.</li>
<li> Chin-ups.</li>
<li> Forward-leaning Suspension dips.</li>
<li> Straight-up Suspension dips.</li>
<li> Suspension leg lift, up till your torso also curls (not only leg lift).</li>
<li> Side moving planks.</li>
<li> Single-legged squat, with full leg extension up to a point where you also
  extend your feet (i.e. single-legged standing calf raise).</li>
<li> Shoulder press.</li>
<li> Chest-pull.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.4"><a class="hindex" href="#3.4">3.4.</a> repetition</h3>

<p>The repetition of each workout item in the routine should be maximum possible
(to failure), given the following constraint:  <em>must not exceed 10</em>.  Ideally,
aim for 5 as the max (if you have enough weight around to achieve that).</p>

<p>If you find yourself able to exceed 10, then add extra weights so that you end
up failing no later than the 10th repetition.  E.g. if you can do more than 10
pull-ups, then hold a dumbbell with your legs so that you fail by the 10th
repetition.</p>

<h3 id="3.5"><a class="hindex" href="#3.5">3.5.</a> daily nutrition</h3>

<ul>
<li> 1 serving of multi-vitamin pills.  Let's get real, most of us don't have much
  time to eat diverse-enough set of fruits.</li>
<li> An amount of proteins as suggested by the  <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">TDEE Calculator</a>,
  given the constraint that the total calories does not exceed what's also
  suggested by  <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">it</a>.</li>
<li> Drink a good amount of water.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ontological_arg_failed"><a class="hindex" href="#ontological_arg_failed">4.</a> where does the ontological argument go wrong</h2>

<p>The argument starts by defining God as:</p>

<p id="cite_god"><strong><a href="#cite_god">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>God is a maximally great being.</em></p>

<p>This, by definition, implies that God exists, because maximal greatness implies
existence.  Also, &ldquo;<em>being</em>&rdquo; requires existence as far as I understand English.
So, yeah, things that are defined to exist, exist.  Duh.</p>

<p>So a better definition is:</p>

<p id="cite_godbetter"><strong><a href="#cite_godbetter">Definition 2.</a></strong> <em>God is a concept for a:
<span class="ignored">$$\begin{cases}
\text{maximally great being} & \text{ if existing IRL}\\
\text{fictional character} & \text{ else}\\
\end{cases}$$</span></em></p>

<p>Now, good luck proving God's existence using  <a href="#cite_godbetter">Definition 2</a>.</p>

<p id="cite_notyet"><strong><a href="#cite_notyet">Note 3.</a></strong> <em>This doesn't mean that &mdash;God forbid&mdash; God doesn't exist.  It just means
      that the ontological argument is pointless.  There is still a lot of good
      reasons to follow God's path.  IMO God's path is the best path to follow.</em></p>

<h3 id="5.1"><a class="hindex" href="#5.1">5.1.</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a>'s conclusions<sup><a href="#fn_watiunderstood">2</a></sup></h3>

<h3 id="5.2"><a class="hindex" href="#5.2">5.2.</a> my attempt after  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a>'s footsteps</h3>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a> didn't define what's positive.  Some say he didn't because he felt it
is subjectively/morally obvious.  But I already did the work of objectively
defining poisitive things, without needing the subjective/moral agreement.  IMO
it's easy to show what's <em>positive</em> by linking it to <em>good</em> as I did
earlier<sup><a href="#fn_detailselsewhere">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p id="cite_positive"><strong><a href="#cite_positive">Definition 6.</a></strong> <em>A property <span class="ignored">$b$</span> is positive if it's good for <span class="ignored">$x$</span>.</em></p>

<p id="cite_good"><strong><a href="#cite_good">Definition 7.</a></strong> <em>A property <span class="ignored">$b$</span> is good for <span class="ignored">$x$</span> if helps maximizing <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s
           survivability<sup><a href="#fn_detailselsewhere">3</a></sup>.</em></p>

<p>Welp&hellip; by  <a href="#cite_godlike">Definition 3</a>,  <a href="#cite_positive">Definition 6</a> and  <a href="#cite_good">Definition 7</a>, God exists by, welp, definition.
Since survivability <em>is</em> existence &mdash;  Q.E.D.</p>

<p>So, as you see,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a>'s path is kinda boring.  The moment he <em>defines</em> God to
be all-positive, is the moment he defines God to exist.  So all that dance that
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a> did is kinda weasely IMO.</p>

<h2 id="6"><a class="hindex" href="#6">6.</a> how is the simulator?</h2>

<p>As you might have already heard,  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/">we <em>might</em> be in a simulation</a>
right now.  In this column I describe a test that lays the foundation for a
principled approach to estimate properties about the parent existence that is
simulating us!</p>

<p>The shit herein is <em>pretty dope</em> and opens new gates to a whole new class of
observatories.  If you think that the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)</a> was <em>freaking</em> cool, then my shit
herein is <em>OMG mega freaking dope cool</em> cool.</p>

<h3 id="6.1"><a class="hindex" href="#6.1">6.1.</a> how many nested simulations?</h3>

<p>IMO, our universe could be simulated in a parent universe, and latter could be
itself simulated in a grand parent universe, etc.  Look at  <a href="#cite_7skies">Figure 3</a>&hellip; some
ancient dudes had some related thoughts.</p>

<figure id="cite_7skies" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Seven paradises" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Mohammed%C2%B4s_Paradise.jpg/220px-Mohammed%C2%B4s_Paradise.jpg" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_7skies">Figure 3.</a></strong> Was dude thinking of simulations?</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="6.2"><a class="hindex" href="#6.2">6.2.</a> what to know about it?</h3>

<p>IMO, universes that end up simulating other universes, probably must be sharing
something common between them.  After all, they are the universes that ended up
simulating others.</p>

<p>So, IMO, if we:</p>

<ol>
<li> Simulate many universes, each initialized with randomized physics laws.  So
  each universe seems independent from each other, and our universe.</li>
<li> Wait to see which ones end up simulating other universes.</li>
<li> Look at those that are simulating other universes, and see if they share
  unique patterns that non-simulating universes lack.</li>
</ol>
<p>I mean, imagine if almost all universes that we simulate, that themselves end
up simulating others, share some common properties that is only unique among
them (but not among universes that don't simulate other universes), won't you
then feel that our parent universe is probably more likely to also have those
properties?  After all it is also one that has simulated another universe (our
universe).</p>

<h3 id="6.3"><a class="hindex" href="#6.3">6.3.</a> problems</h3>

<p>We probably can't simulate a rat's ass these days, so all this is wishful
thinking that, one day, when computers are powerful enough, we might have
better guesses about how might our parent universe be.</p>

<p>But there is certain amount of badass-ness that our universe can't simulate.
E.g. our universe can't simulate a universe that can solve problems that are
not solvable by Turing machines.</p>

<p>But, still, if we do these simulations, we can possibly end up updating our
probability model about our parent universe's properties.  Currently, we know
nothing.  But after those simulations, maybe we could say &ldquo;<em>welp.. probably it
has X!</em>&rdquo;.</p>
