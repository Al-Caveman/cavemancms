<h2 id="sec_1"><a href="#sec_1">1. parent existence observatory (PEO)</a></h2>

<p>As you might have already heard,  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/">we <em>might</em> be in a simulation</a> right now.  In this column I
describe a test that lays the foundation for a principled approach to estimate
properties about the parent existence that is simulating us!</p>

<p>The shit herein is <em>pretty dope</em> and opens new gates to a whole new class of
observatories.  If you think that the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)</a> was <em>freaking</em> cool, then my shit
herein is <em>OMG mega freaking dope cool</em> cool.</p>

<h3 id="sec_1.1"><a href="#sec_1.1">1.1. how many nested simulations?</a></h3>

<p>If we are in a simulation, we don't know whether the form of existence outside
this simulation is, <em>itself</em>, real either.  We might be in a pretty deep
recursion of simulations.</p>

<p>To simplify the language, let <span class="ignored">\(e_0\)</span> be the form of existence that we refer to
as <em>&ldquo;the universe&rdquo;</em>, and <span class="ignored">\(e_{-1}\)</span> be the form of existence that is hosting a
machine that is simulating the form of existence <span class="ignored">\(e_0\)</span>.</p>

<p>You may subjectively think that the form of existence <span class="ignored">\(e_{-1}\)</span> is more real
than the one referred to by <span class="ignored">\(e_0\)</span>, but <span class="ignored">\(e_{-1}\)</span> itself could also be
nothing but a yet another simulation in a yet grander parent form of existence
<span class="ignored">\(e_{-2}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Generally, for any <span class="ignored">\(i &gt; m\)</span>, let <span class="ignored">\(e_i\)</span> be a form of existence that is being
simulated in a machine in <span class="ignored">\(e_{i-1}\)</span>.  Let <span class="ignored">\(e_m\)</span> be the master form of
existence that is not simulated by any other simulation.  If <span class="ignored">\(m = \infty\)</span>,
then the recursion of simulations keeps going on indefinitely.</p>

<p>Is the ancient concept of a multi-layered skies, or worlds, related to this
concept of nested simulations?   <a href="#cite_7skies1">Figure 1</a> shows an example of such ancient
imaginations that might suggest that <span class="ignored">\(m=-7\)</span>.</p>

<figure id="cite_7skies1" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Seven paradises" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Mohammed%C2%B4s_Paradise.jpg/220px-Mohammed%C2%B4s_Paradise.jpg" /><figcaption><a href="#cite_7skies1">Figure 1.</a> An ancient dude's imagination of a 7 layered worlds view.  Was he
thinking <span class="ignored">\(m=-7\)</span>?</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="sec_1.2"><a href="#sec_1.2">1.2. what to know about <span class="ignored">\(e_{i-1}\)</span>?</a></h3>

<p>Basically we want to answer some binary questions about the existences <span class="ignored">\(e_0,
e_{-1}, \ldots, e_m\)</span>.  Let's put them in a matrix:</p>

<p><span class="ignored">$$\mathbf{Q} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    q_{e_0, 1} & q_{e_0, 2} & q_{e_0, 3} & \dots & q_{e_0, n} \\
    q_{e_{-1}, 1} & q_{e_{-1}, 2} & q_{e_{-1}, 3} & \dots & q_{e_{-1}, n} \\
    \vdots \\
    q_{e_m, 1} & q_{e_m, 2} & q_{e_m, 3} & \dots & q_{e_m, n} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$</span></p>

<p>Obviously you can see that each row contains questions about a specific
existence.  Here are some examples for questions about existence <span class="ignored">\(e_{-1}\)</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li> Question <span class="ignored">\(q_{e_{-1}, 1}\)</span>: did <span class="ignored">\(e_{-1}\)</span> simulate a child existence to test
  criminals in their existence?</li>
<li> Question <span class="ignored">\(q_{e_{-1}, 2}\)</span>: did <span class="ignored">\(e_{-1}\)</span> simulate a child existence to infer
  information their parent existence?</li>
<li> &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Then our <em>wish</em> is to find the answers matrix:
<span class="ignored">$$\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{e_0, 1} & a_{e_0, 2} & a_{e_0, 3} & \dots & a_{e_0, n} \\
    a_{e_{-1}, 1} & a_{e_{-1}, 2} & a_{e_{-1}, 3} & \dots & a_{e_{-1}, n} \\
    \vdots \\
    a_{e_m, 1} & a_{e_m, 2} & a_{e_m, 3} & \dots & a_{e_m, n} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$</span></p>

<p>We can estimate answers in matrix <span class="ignored">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> by estimating the probability
<span class="ignored">\(\Pr(a_{j, j} = \text{Yes})\)</span>, for every answer in the matrix.  I.e.:
<span class="ignored">$$\mathbf{\hat A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \hat\Pr(a_{e_0, 1}    = \text{Yes}) & \dots & \hat\Pr(a_{e_0, n} = \text{Yes}) \\
    \hat\Pr(a_{e_{-1}, 1} = \text{Yes}) & \dots & \hat\Pr(a_{e_{-1}, n} = \text{Yes}) \\
    \vdots \\
    \hat\Pr(a_{e_m, 1}    = \text{Yes}) & \dots & \hat\Pr(a_{e_m, n} = \text{Yes}) \\
\end{bmatrix}$$</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_1.3"><a href="#sec_1.3">1.3. how to find <span class="ignored">\(\hat\Pr(a_{i, j} = \text{Yes})\)</span>?</a></h3>

<p>The short answer is:  in a similar way to how people predict the future.  E.g.
some predict future stock market prices by analyzing past years (2018, 2017,
&hellip;).  It generally works for them, and their models offer answers notably
better than random-chance guessing.</p>

<p>The future stock market prediction works, because we have seen input from the
past years.  E.g.:</p>

<ol>
<li> Analyze past data gathered from years 2010 and 2011, then hypothesize a model
  <span class="ignored">\(m_1\)</span> about price changes.  Test <span class="ignored">\(m_1\)</span> on year 2012.  </li>
<li> Analyze past data gathered from years 2010, 2011 and 2012, then hypothesize a
  model <span class="ignored">\(m_2\)</span> by improving  <span class="ignored">\(m_2\)</span>.  Test <span class="ignored">\(m_1\)</span> on data from year 2013.  </li>
<li> &hellip;</li>
<li> Analyze past data gathered from years 2010, 2011, &hellip;,  2018, then
  hypothesize a model <span class="ignored">\(m_6\)</span> by improving  <span class="ignored">\(m_5\)</span>.  Use model <span class="ignored">\(m_6\)</span> to
  predict the future that is 2019<sup><a href="#fn_future1">1</a></sup>!.  </li>
</ol>
<p>But the problem with finding <span class="ignored">\(\hat\Pr(a_{i, j} = \text{Yes})\)</span> is that we
currently lack any past observations.  Therefore, if we try to define
<span class="ignored">\(\mathbf{\hat A}\)</span> now, with our little knowledge, it might look like this:</p>

<p><span class="ignored">$$\mathbf{\hat A_1} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0.5 & 0.5 & \dots & 0.5 \\
    0.5 & 0.5 & \dots & 0.5 \\
    \vdots \\
    0.5 & 0.5 & \dots & 0.5 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$</span></p>

<p><span class="ignored">\(\mathbf{\hat A_1}\)</span> is obviously pretty useless!</p>

<p>Here is my suggestion in PEO:</p>

<ol>
<li> Using computers, or some machines, we run existence simulations.  E.g.
  imagine a large super computer simulating big bang, with some laws of
  physics.  We may try laws of physics similar to our's, or try random laws of
  physics for each simulation instance.  E.g. thousands of big bang
  simulations,each with their own laws of physics.</li>
<li> We observe the existences that form in the simulations.</li>
<li> Some of those simulations may develop intelligent life that, themselves, will
  create their own simulation (inside our super computers), and have their own
  big bangs!</li>
<li> We observe simulations in the simulations, too.  This way, we keep collecting
  information about existences <span class="ignored">\(e_{0+1}, e_{0+2}, \ldots\)</span> that are children
  to our existence <span class="ignored">\(e_0\)</span>.  Since they are running in our supercomputers, we
  can also find the correct answers to questions, such as <span class="ignored">\(q_{e_1, 1}\)</span>.  Eventually, we end up creating a new questions matrix:</li>
<li> Then, observing all that, we create these matrices:
    <span class="ignored">$$    \mathbf{Q_s} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        q_{e_0, 1} & q_{e_0, 2} & q_{e_0, 3} & \dots & q_{e_0, n} \\
        q_{e_{1}, 1} & q_{e_{1}, 2} & q_{e_{1}, 3} & \dots & q_{e_{1}, n} \\
        \vdots \\
        q_{e_w, 1} & q_{e_w, 2} & q_{e_w, 3} & \dots & q_{e_w, n} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$</span><p>And also its answers matrix!
    <span class="ignored">$$    \mathbf{A_s} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{e_0, 1} & a_{e_0, 2} & a_{e_0, 3} & \dots & a_{e_0, n} \\
        a_{e_{1}, 1} & a_{e_{1}, 2} & a_{e_{1}, 3} & \dots & a_{e_{1}, n} \\
        \vdots \\
        a_{e_w, 1} & a_{e_w, 2} & a_{e_w, 3} & \dots & a_{e_w, n} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$</span>
+ With enough repetition of simulations, we might get to also estimate things
  like confidence intervals, or statistical significance measures to better
  test our hypothesis/answers.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>By analyzing <span class="ignored">\(\mathbf{Q_s}\)</span> and <span class="ignored">\(\mathbf{A_s}\)</span>, we <em>may</em> identify
patterns that link properties in child simulations against their parent
simulations.  We can also test the model using <em>train/validation/test</em> splits.
Until we find an answering model that has an error that is low enough.  Let's
call this model <span class="ignored">\(\hat g\)</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, by running model <span class="ignored">\(\hat g\)</span> on the original questions <span class="ignored">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span>,
we get a better answers matrix <span class="ignored">\(\mathcal{\hat A_2}\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="ignored">$$\mathbf{\hat A_2} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0.55 & 0.49 & \dots & 0.38 \\
    0.51 & 0.5 & \dots & 0.43 \\
    \vdots \\
    0.5 & 0.5 & \dots & 0.5 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$</span></p>

<p>There you go! By analyzing our universe, and child simulations of other
existences in our universe that we made, we might be able to answer questions
about the parent existence that is simulating us (if we are being simulated)!</p>

<h2 id="sec_2"><a href="#sec_2">2. what is <em>good</em>?</a></h2>

<p>When people debate, they often say things like: <span class="ignored">\(x\)</span> is good, <span class="ignored">\(y\)</span> is not
good, why is <span class="ignored">\(z\)</span> good? Etc.  Yet rarely ever they discuss the fundamental
question: what is <em>good</em> itself? Based on what criteria a thing becomes good?</p>

<p>It is logically impossible for two people to <em>meaningfully</em> debate whether
<span class="ignored">\(x\)</span> is good, while them having different definitions of <em>good</em>.  If they ever
conclude something correctly, it must be thanks to the amount of sheer dumb
luck that accidentally served them.  As a result, <span class="ignored">\(99.99\%\)</span><sup><a href="#fn_assnumber2">2</a></sup> of all
debates are useless and cyclic.</p>

<p>To cut the chase short, here is what I think is the <em>best</em> definition of
<em>good</em>:</p>

<p id="cite_defgood1"><a href="#cite_defgood1">Definition 1.</a> <em>A thing <span class="ignored">\(t\)</span> is good for <span class="ignored">\(x\)</span> if <span class="ignored">\(t\)</span> maximizes <span class="ignored">\(x\)</span>'s
              survivabiliy.</em></p>

<p> <a href="#cite_defgood1">Definition 1</a> has these nice properties:</p>

<ul>
<li> It can be <em>objectively</em> measured!  We can use statistics, biology, etc, to
    measure expected values of how <em>good</em> a thing is!</li>
<li> All other definitions of <em>good</em> are all dependant on <em>survivability
    maximization</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't believe me?  Let's look at other definitions:</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood11"><a href="#cite_pplgood11">Quote 1:</a><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Common sense dictates what is good.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Dude McDudeface</cite></footer></figure>

<p>The <em>common sense</em> that is proposed in  <a href="#cite_pplgood11">Quote 1</a> depends on the biological
configuration of the people that their <em>common sense</em> is analyzed.  The
biological configuration, <em>itself</em>, is a function of <em>evolution</em>.  As you know,
evolution makes use of <em>natural selection</em>, which rewards patterns that have
higher survivability.</p>

<p>I know evolution itself is not a confirmed fact, but a mere guess.  But come on
dude.. it's the best guess we have now.  Do you have any better guess?</p>

<p>Therefore, IMO it's fair to say that common sense <em>itself</em> is nothing but a
mere parameter that is tweaked by evolution to achieve a higher survivability
maximization of the species at hand (in this case humans).  See! It came back
to  <a href="#cite_defgood1">Definition 1</a>!</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood22"><a href="#cite_pplgood22">Quote 2:</a><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Good is whatever that makes me feel happy.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Faggot McFilth</cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_pplgood22">Quote 2</a> has the same inadequacy problem that  <a href="#cite_pplgood11">Quote 1</a> suffers.
Eventually, the <em>happiness</em> feeling, itself, is also a mere parameter that was
tweaked throught the ages, due to evolution, in order to allow mankind to
survive better.  As you can see, happiness itself seems to be a <em>proxy</em> that
reflects survivability maximization.  Again.. back to  <a href="#cite_defgood1">Definition 1</a>!</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood33"><a href="#cite_pplgood33">Quote 3:</a><blockquote><em>&ldquo;But what if happiness is not a function of evolution, but rather a
           function of soul/spirits from another world?&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Nagger McNugget</cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_pplgood33">Quote 3</a> is possibly true,  but, we can't measure/test souls/spirits, or
things beyong the measurable world.  Therefore, while  <a href="#cite_pplgood33">Quote 3</a> might be true,
we can't use it to verify any hypotheses.  As a result, I suggest that it is
perhaps better to not define <em>good</em> based on it.</p>

<p>So.. this leaves us with  <a href="#cite_defgood1">Definition 1</a> as the the most general/basic measurable
definition so far.  What do you think?  Can you find any better definition than
 <a href="#cite_defgood1">Definition 1</a>?</p>
