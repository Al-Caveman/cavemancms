<h2 id="1"><a class="hindex" href="#1">1.</a> a simpler way for users to reply to blogs</h2>

<p>Commonly, a web server that's hosting  a blog should:</p>

<ul>
<li> Present some comments upload form.
</li>
<li> Be able to handle uploaded users <em>data</em> (e.g. post or
  get or whatever requests).</li>
<li> Then, the web server runs some dynamic code that reads the user
  upload data.</li>
<li> And then writes/saves something somewhere (e.g. to store the
  end-user's comment). The comment is usually stored in some
  back-end database, like some evil SQL stuff.</li>
<li> Additionally, the user usually also needs to register an
  account for the blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>We all know that, right?  In fact, it's so common that most people don't even
realize a sad aspect: all of the points from (1) to (5) are redundant, and we
already have a system for it, that almost everyone uses:  <em>the email
system</em>.  It's so obvious that most people are unable to see.  But here is
how:</p>

<ul>
<li> Email clients already have highly capable upload forms, with
   capacity of handling attachments, cryptographic signatures,
   etc.</li>
<li> Email servers already uploaded stuff (texts, attachments).</li>
<li> Email servers can already run some dynamic code that reads the
   user upload data and reacts accordingly.  Some use this feature
   to dynamically create support tickets from email.</li>
<li> Email servers can obviously writes/saves something somewhere
   (e.g. to store the end-user's comment).</li>
<li> The email system allows user registration (e.g. registering to
   free email providers, or registering for a domain name and let
   user host his own mail servers, etc).  The email registration
   is also powerful in that, it already has an infrastructure to
   handle abusers if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>So much redundancies.  Since I'll already have an email server, here is how
I'll solve this problem for this blog, in order to less-redundantly allow for
user posts:</p>

<ul>
<li> Blog's web server will be a read-only  <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a>.  Nothing dynamic, just
   vanilla  <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a>.</li>
<li> Each blog post will have a unique identifier, say, the
   identifier is <code>123456</code> for this post.</li>
<li> The reply link will be a <code>mailto</code> anchor
   to the email address <code>123456.reply@caveman.sexy</code>.</li>
<li> The user posts his reply to that email address, and will get to
   set various options by using special tags in the body of the
   email, in order to set his nickname, or whether he wants to be
   notified when someone replies to his comment.</li>
<li> The mail server will get the message, parse it dynamically, if
   things are OK, then translate it into a HTML/CSS content, and
   update the static pages of this blog.</li>
<li> Users will then see the updated site html files with the newly
   posted reply.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side effect:</p>

<ul>
<li> I'll not need to create user registration forms.</li>
<li> I'll not need to create post-reply forms.</li>
<li> Since  <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> will be fully dealing with static content,
  if-modified-since will work conveniently out of the box, and be
  mega fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>This might not be necessarily new, but it is certainly at least an extremely
uncommon method of handling blog posts/replies.  IMO we live in a very sad time
where most people, even standard bodies, needlessly create redundant systems.</p>

<h2 id="2"><a class="hindex" href="#2">2.</a> the godly prisoner's dilemma is better imo</h2>

<p>You have probably heard of the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>.  I call it the <em>Godless</em>
prisoner's dilemma for the obvious reason: it lacks God.  this should be fair
enough.</p>

<p>A quick reminder of the <em>Godless</em> dilemma: it says something like, 2 dudes in a
prison with these options: if one snitches, but the other doesn't, the snitcher
gets out of prison immediately, and the snitched will be there for a very long
time, like 10 years or something.  If none snitch, they will be imprisoned for
3 months.  If both snitch, then they will be imprisoned for 1 year.</p>

<p>But what about the <em>Godly</em> prisoner's dilemma, where we modify it to include
the following clause:  <em>you are always being watched by a fair God, who will
reward you accordingly based on how truthful and honest you are</em>.  Then
suddenly we are dealing with a different problem, where the imprisoned dudes
have more incentives to just be honest, and say the truth..</p>

<p>I expect the Godly prisoner's dilemma to be more likely to result in a solution
that is more optimum for the greatness of the individuals, and humanity as a
whole.  After all, it places more incentives to say the truth, thanks to
believing in God.</p>

<h2 id="3"><a class="hindex" href="#3">3.</a> multi column text. nice?</h2>

<p>Try to adjust the width of the browser's window, or adjust the text size.
You'll notice that the text will be distributed in columns, automatically, to
maximize screen's utility.  Most websites don't do this, unfortunately..</p>

<p>This is a demonstration of a website whose content gets distributed in multiple
columns, depending on the width of the browser window, just like news papers
(as shown in  <a href="#cite_anewspaper">Figure 1</a>).  The goal is to make sure that a column is never
too wide, nor screen space is.  IMO this is the best idea for maximizing
screen's utility.</p>

<figure id="cite_anewspaper" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="A random newspaper." src="/pics/newspaper.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_anewspaper">Figure 1.</a></strong> A random newspaper.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Much like how news papers make efficient use of their wide papers by using
multiple columns (instead of too wide lines of texts, or wasting paper sides).
But unfortunately many websites, today, don't respect our wide screens, and
rather opt to waste side pixels.</p>

<h2 id="4"><a class="hindex" href="#4">4.</a> godly general public license v3 (ggplv3)</h2>

<p>GNU/RMS pushed towards freeing software, but not free enough.  The GGPL3.0
addresses a key limitation in  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPLv3</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, GPLv3 ensures that the software remains free, but it ignores the
fact that software could be used to push humanity towards extinction.  In such
a case, what use would free software make if there are no humans to use it?</p>

<p>The GGPLv3 effectively prefixes GPLv3 by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">The Ten Commandments</a>.  This means you won't be
allowed to use GGPLv3-licensed stuff to, say, run a fornication website,
operate an abortion clinic, dishonour your father,
etc.</p>

<figure id="cite_10cmdsimg" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Artist's imagination of the tablets." src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Vitrail_de_synagogue-Mus%C3%A9e_alsacien_de_Strasbourg.jpg/150px-Vitrail_de_synagogue-Mus%C3%A9e_alsacien_de_Strasbourg.jpg" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_10cmdsimg">Figure 2.</a></strong> Artist's imagination of the tablets.</figcaption></figure>

<p>This is nice, because the things banned in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">The Ten Commandments</a> seem to result in higher
divorce rate, higher std, lower birth rate, etc; generally humanity's
extinction.  Stats also seem to suggest this.  So, unless you want to have a
world with free code but no humans -to use the code-, your need to adopt the
GGPLv3 license.</p>
