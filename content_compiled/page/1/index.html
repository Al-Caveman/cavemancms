<h2>a simpler way for users to reply to blogs</h2>
<p>commonly, a web server that's hosting  a blog should:</p>

<p><ol>
    <li>
        present some comments upload form.
    </li>
    <li>
        be able to handle uploaded users <em>data</em> (e.g. post or
        get or whatever requests).
    </li>
    <li>
        then, the web server runs some dynamic code that reads the user
        upload data.
    </li>
    <li>
        and then writes/saves something somewhere (e.g. to store the
        end-user's comment). the comment is usually stored in some
        back-end database, like some evil sql stuff.
    </li>
    <li>
        additionally, the user usually also needs to register an
        account for the blog.
    </li>
</ol></p>

<p>we all know that, right?  in fact, it's so common that most ppl don't even
realize a sad aspect: all of the points from (1) to (5) are redundant, and we
already have a system for it, that almost everyone uses:  <em>the email
system</em>.  it's so obvious tht most ppl r unable to see.  but here is how:</p>

<p><ol>
    <li>email clients already have highly capable upload forms, with
        capacity of handling attachments, cryptographic signatures,
        etc.</li>
    <li>email servers already uploaded stuff (texts, attachments).</li>
    <li>email servers can already run some dynamic code that reads the
        user upload data and reacts accordingly.  some use this feature
        to dynamically create support tickets from email.</li>
    <li>email servers can obviously writes/saves something somewhere
        (e.g. to store the end-user's comment).</li>
    <li>the email system allows user registration (e.g. registering to
        free email providers, or registering for a domain name and let
        user host his own mail servers, etc).  the email registration
        is also powerful in that, it already has an infrastructure to
        handle abusers if needed.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>so much redundancies.  since i'll already have an email server, here is how
i'll solve this problem for this blog, in order to less-redundantly allow for
user posts:</p>

<p><ol>
    <li>blog's web server will be a read-only <a
        href='https://nginx.org/'>nginx</a>.  nothing dynamic, just
        vanilla nginx.</li>
    <li>each blog post will have a unique identifier, say, the
        identifier is <em>123456</em> for this post.</li>
    <li>the &ldquo;<em>reply</em>&rdquo; link will be a mailto anchor
        to the email address <em>123456.reply@caveman.sexy</em>.</li>
    <li>the user posts his reply to that email address, and will get to
        set various options by using special tags in the body of the
        email, in order to set his nickname, or whether he wants to be
        notified when someone replies to his comment.</li>
    <li>the mail server will get the message, parse it dynamically, if
        things r ok, then translate it into a html/css content, and
        update the static pages of this blog.</li>
    <li>users will then see the updated site html files with the newly
        posted reply.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>as a side effect:</p>

<p><ul>
    <li>i'll not need to create user registration forms.</li>
    <li>i'll not need to create post-reply forms.</li>
    <li>since nginx will be fully dealing with static content,
        if-modified-since will work conveniently out of the box, and be
        mega fast.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>this might not be necessarily new, but it is certainly at least an extremely
uncommon method of handling blog posts/replies.  imo we live in a very sad time
where most ppl, even standard bodies, needlessly create redundant systems.</p>

<h2>the Godly prisoner's dilemma is better; imo</h2>
<p>u probably heard of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>.
i call it the <em>Godless</em> prisoner's dilemma for the obvious reason: it
lacks God.  this should be fair enough.</p>

<p>a quick reminder of the [Godless] dilemma: it says something like, 2 dudes in a
prison with these options: if one snitches, but the other doesn't, the snitcher
gets out of prison immediately, and the snitched will be there for a very long
time, like 10 years or something.  if none snitch, they will be imprisoned for
3 months.  if both snitch, then they will be imprisoned for 1 year.  or
something like this.</p>

<p>iirc it's shown that, in practice, under the constraints of the scenario of the
dilemma, ppl will choose to snitch against each other, thus reaching a
sub-optimal global solution.  so, they end up being imprisoned for 1 year,
instead of 3 months.</p>

<p>but what about the <em>Godly</em> prisoner's dilemma, where we modify it to
include the following clause:  <em>you are always being watched by a fair God,
who will reward you accordingly based on how truthful and honest you are</em>.
then suddenly we r dealing with a different problem, where the imprisoned dudes
have more incentives to just be honest, and say the truth..</p>

<p>i expect the Godly prisoner's dilemma to be more likely to result in a solution
that is more optimum for the greatness of the individuals, and humanity as a
whole. after all, it places more incentives to say the truth, thanks to
believing in God.</p>

<h2>multi column text. nice?</h2>
<p>try to adjust the width of the browser's window, or adjust the text size.  u'll
notice that the text will be distributed in columns, automatically, to maximize
screen's utility.  most websites don't do this, unfortunately..</p>

<p>this is a demonstration of a website whose content gets distributed in multiple
columns, depending on the width of the browser window, just like news papers.
the goal is to make sure that a column is never too wide, nor screen space is.
imo this is the best idea for maximizing screen's utility.</p>

<p><figure>

        <b>fig 3.</b> a random newspaper.
    </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>much like how news papers make efficient use of their wide papers by using
multiple columns (instead of too wide lines of texts, or wasting paper sides).
but unfortunately many websites, today, don't rspect our wide screens, and
rather opt to waste side pixels.</p>

<h2>Godly general public license 3.0 (Ggpl3.0)</h2>
<p>gnu/rms pushed towards freeing software, but not free enough.  the Ggpl3.0
addresses a key limitation in <a
href='https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html'>gpl3.0</a>.</p>

<p>basically, gpl3.0 ensures that the software remains free, but it ignoves the
fact that software could be used to push humanity towards extinction.  in such
a case, what use would free software make if there r no humanies to use it?</p>

<p>the Ggpl3.0 effectively prefixes gpl3.0 by the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments'>ten commandments</a>, so
that u r not allowed to use a Ggpl3.0-licensed software in anything that
violates the ten commandments.</p>

<p><figure>
    <img alt='10 commandments' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Vitrail_de_synagogue-Mus%C3%A9e_alsacien_de_Strasbourg.jpg/150px-Vitrail_de_synagogue-Mus%C3%A9e_alsacien_de_Strasbourg.jpg' />
    <figcaption>
        <b>fig 4.</b> the ten commandments (artist's imagination of the
        tablets).
    </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>this means u won't be allowed to use Ggpl3.0-licensed stuff to, say, run an
adultery website, operate an abortion clinic, dishonour ur daddy, etc.</p>

<p>this is bcoz the stuff banned in the ten commandments seem result in higher
divorce rate, higher std, lower birth rate, etc; generally humanity's
extinction.  stats also seem to suggest this.  so, unless u want to have a
world with free code but no humans -to use the code-, u need to adopt the
Ggpl3.0 license.</p>

<h2>testing mathjax</h2>
<p>When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ more fancy things to test mathjax's
things:
\[
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{ if } x = 1\\
        1 & \text{ otherwise}\\
    \end{cases}
\]</p>
