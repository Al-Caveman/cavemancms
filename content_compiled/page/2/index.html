<h2 id="what_is_good"><a class="hindex" href="#what_is_good">1.</a> what is <em>good</em>?</h2>

<p>When people debate, they often say things like: <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is good, <span class="ignored">$y$</span> is not
good, why is <span class="ignored">$z$</span> good? Etc.  Yet rarely ever they discuss the fundamental
question: what is <em>good</em> itself? Based on what criteria a thing becomes good?</p>

<p>It is logically impossible for two people to <em>meaningfully</em> debate whether
<span class="ignored">$x$</span> is good, while them having different definitions of <em>good</em>.  If they ever
conclude something correctly, it must be thanks to the amount of sheer dumb
luck that accidentally served them.  As a result, <span class="ignored">$99.99\%$</span><sup><a href="#fn_assnumber">1</a></sup> of all
debates are useless and cyclic.</p>

<p>To cut the chase short, here is what I think is the <em>best</em> definition of
<em>good</em>:</p>

<p id="cite_defgood"><strong><a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>A thing <span class="ignored">$t$</span> is good for <span class="ignored">$x$</span> if <span class="ignored">$t$</span> maximizes <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s
              survivabiliy.</em></p>

<p> <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 1</a> has these nice properties:</p>

<ul>
<li> It can be <em>objectively</em> measured!  We can use statistics, biology, etc, to
    measure expected values of how <em>good</em> a thing is!</li>
<li> All other definitions of <em>good</em> are all dependant on <em>survivability
    maximization</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't believe me?  Let's look at other definitions:</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood1"><strong><a href="#cite_pplgood1">Quote 1:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Common sense dictates what is good.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Dude McDudeface</cite></footer></figure>

<p>The <em>common sense</em> that is proposed in  <a href="#cite_pplgood1">Quote 1</a> depends on the biological
configuration of the people that their <em>common sense</em> is analyzed.  The
biological configuration, <em>itself</em>, is a function of <em>evolution</em>.  As you know,
evolution makes use of <em>natural selection</em>, which rewards patterns that have
higher survivability.</p>

<p>I know evolution itself is not a confirmed fact, but a mere guess.  But come on
dude.. it's the best guess we have now.  Do you have any better guess?</p>

<p>Therefore, IMO it's fair to say that common sense <em>itself</em> is nothing but a
mere parameter that is tweaked by evolution to achieve a higher survivability
maximization of the species at hand (in this case humans).  See! It came back
to  <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 1</a>!</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood2"><strong><a href="#cite_pplgood2">Quote 2:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Good is whatever that makes me feel happy.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Faggot McFilth</cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_pplgood2">Quote 2</a> has the same inadequacy problem that  <a href="#cite_pplgood1">Quote 1</a> suffers.
Eventually, the <em>happiness</em> feeling, itself, is also a mere parameter that was
tweaked throught the ages, due to evolution, in order to allow mankind to
survive better.  As you can see, happiness itself seems to be a <em>proxy</em> that
reflects survivability maximization.  Again.. back to  <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 1</a>!</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood3"><strong><a href="#cite_pplgood3">Quote 3:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;But what if happiness is not a function of evolution, but rather a
           function of soul/spirits from another world?&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Nagger McNugget</cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_pplgood3">Quote 3</a> is possibly true,  but, we can't measure/test souls/spirits, or
things beyong the measurable world.  Therefore, while  <a href="#cite_pplgood3">Quote 3</a> might be true,
we can't use it to verify any hypotheses.  As a result, I suggest that it is
perhaps better to not define <em>good</em> based on it.</p>

<p>So.. this leaves us with  <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 1</a> as the the most general/basic measurable
definition so far.  What do you think?  Can you find any better definition than
 <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 1</a>?</p>

<h2 id="2"><a class="hindex" href="#2">2.</a>  <a href="https://github.com/al-caveman/cavemark">CaveMark</a> is out!</h2>

<p>CavemanCMS, and all articles in this website, currently use  <a href="https://github.com/al-caveman/cavemark">CaveMark</a> as their
markdown parser.  Neat <span class="ignored">$\LaTeX$</span>-like formatting with little effort!</p>

<p>CaveMark is nice because it:</p>

<ol>
<li> Follows typesetting principles.</li>
<li> Is the
fastest<sup><a href="#fn_clarifyspeed">2</a></sup> pure-Python markdown parser around.  It easily beats
 <a href="https://github.com/lepture/mistune">mistune</a> in CPython3:<p><pre><code>mistune : 18.17786209 seconds
cavemark: 9.386662586 seconds (1.9 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<p>in CPython2:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 19.72612286 seconds
cavemark: 9.484875202 seconds (2.1 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<p>in PyPy3:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 12.31156345 seconds
cavemark: 3.191607327 seconds (3.9 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<p>and in PyPy2:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 8.993317127 seconds
cavemark: 1.470407009 seconds (6.1 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

</li>
</ol>

<ul style="list-style:none;padding:0; margin:0;"><li id="fn_clarifyspeed"><small>2. For a Python module, speed, by itself, is not a major criterion in my
view.  But, I think it reflects how carefully CaveMark is developed.</small></li>

<h2 id="3"><a class="hindex" href="#3">3.</a> cavemancms soon!</h2>

<p>CMS = content management system.  E.g. thing that manages content in you blog,
or site.  But they all suck.  So I am making the best CMS ever.  It's called
<em>CavemanCMS</em>.</p>

<p>Usually, existing CMS that are dynamic, e.g. those that allow you to post, and
your users to reply in somewhat real time, require you to run a dynamic web
server.  E.g. maybe FastCGI with PHP/Python, etc.  Of course, right?</p>

<p>But here is the magic:  with CavemanCMS, you shall have a fully dynamic CMS,
yet your website remains fully static.  You shall upload all you want, yet your
web server will not even need to support anything other than GET requests.</p>

<p>And it shall also be blazing fast.  Stay tuned.  This shit is awesome.  God
willing will make some noise.  Trust.</p>

<h2 id="4"><a class="hindex" href="#4">4.</a> how muscle works</h2>

<p>Below is a summary of what I have found so far:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Muscle stimulation period:</em> Some site (forgot) suggested that the
  growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.<p>But not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
  strength, hypertrophy, etc?  Gotta search this..  Someone in YouTube said 48
  hours (WTF?).  Also  <a href="https://www.nautilusplus.com/is-it-necessary-to-rest-24-hours-between-workouts/">some site</a> says 48-72 hours.</p>

</li>
<li> <em>Strength vs. Hypertrophy:</em> Someone (on utube) suggested that strength
  training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance
  by storing more water in the muscle.
</li>
<li> <em>Number of sets:</em> Someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training is
  better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference of
  chest and thigh).
</li>
<li> <em>Resting period between sets</em>:  <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Fulltext/2008/06000/A_Brief_Review__How_Much_Rest_between_Sets_.9.aspx">Some journal</a> suggests that optimum
  resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength training, 30-90secs for
  hypertrophy or endurance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5"><a class="hindex" href="#5">5.</a> me not like decoration; here why</h2>

<p>1st, let's define a couple of things.   <a href="#cite_smartdude">Definition 2</a> defines what is a <em>smart</em>
dude, and  <a href="#cite_decorative">Definition 3</a> defines what is a decorative item.</p>

<p id="cite_smartdude"><strong><a href="#cite_smartdude">Definition 2.</a></strong> <em>A dude <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is said to be smart if, and only if, <span class="ignored">$x$</span> does stuff that
      maximize his survivability, and avoids stuff that limit him from
      maximizing his survivability.  This implies that he eats healthy food,
      learns juicy mathy sciency stuff, avoids wasting his time, etc.</em></p>

<p id="cite_decorative"><strong><a href="#cite_decorative">Definition 3.</a></strong> <em>For a given world <span class="ignored">$w$</span>, a thing <span class="ignored">$t_w$</span> in world <span class="ignored">$w$</span> is said to be
      decorative if, and only if, <span class="ignored">$t_w$</span> does not help its owner maximize his
      survivability in world <span class="ignored">$w$</span>.  I.e. has no real use.  E.g. bunch of
      pretty pics hanging on the wall of your toilet.</em></p>

<p>Think a bit.  If you agree with  <a href="#cite_smartdude">Definition 2</a> and  <a href="#cite_decorative">Definition 3</a>, then  <a href="#cite_smartworld">Theorem 1</a>
is true by definition.</p>

<p id="cite_smartworld"><strong><a href="#cite_smartworld">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>In a world with only smart dudes, then they will not allocate
      any resource, e.g. money/time, to make/buy decorative stuff.  i.e. no
      fancy pics hanging on walls, statues, fancy stitching on clothing, etc.
      but all resources will be used to maximize their survivability.</em></p>

<p>Based on  <a href="#cite_smartworld">Theorem 1</a>, it's easy to see why  <a href="#cite_dumbworld">Theorem 2</a> is also true.</p>

<p id="cite_dumbworld"><strong><a href="#cite_dumbworld">Theorem 2.</a></strong> <em>A world with dudes investing some resource in making/buying
      decorative items, is necessarily a world that has at least 1 non-smart
      person.</em></p>

<p>Now let's be more specific on how the world with some non-smarties, as in the
 <a href="#cite_dumbworld">Theorem 2</a>, would look like:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Possibility 1:</em> Non-smarties are doing a mistake for making/buying
  useless stuff that don't help maximize their survivability.
</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 2:</em> Smarties make/buy decorative items because it
  happens that some non-smarties get manipulated this way more effectively for
  the selfish gains of the smarties.
</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 3:</em> A mixture of the other possibilities above.</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 4:</em> What else?  I can't find any..  This list seems
  complete, IMO.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, they are all sad cases.  I.e. either exploiting smarties, or
misguided non-smarties.  This is why I dislike decorative items: because they
seem to only reflect sad underlying realities (possibilities above are sad
cases IMO, and decorative items remind me of them).</p>
