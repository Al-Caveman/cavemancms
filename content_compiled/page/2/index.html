<h2> CaveMark Is Out!</h2>

<p>CavemanCMS, and all articles in this website, currently use  <a href="https://github.com/al-caveman/cavemark">CaveMark</a> as their
markdown parser.  Neat <span class="ignored">\(\LaTeX\)</span>-like formatting with little effort!</p>

<p>CaveMark is nice because it follows typesetting principles.  It's also the
fastest pure-Python markdown parser around<sup><a href="#fn_neat1">1</a></sup>.  It easily beats  <a href="https://github.com/lepture/mistune">mistune</a> in
CPython3:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 13.928859449 seconds
cavemark: 5.57010197 seconds (2.5 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<p>and in PyPy3:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 10.141159687 seconds
cavemark: 1.728199896 seconds (5.9 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<hr/>
 <ul style="list-style:none;padding:0; margin:0;"><small><li id="fn_neat1">1. But what's really neat is the typesetting aspect.  Check  <a href="https://github.com/al-caveman/cavemark">CaveMark</a>
yourself!</li>

<h2> CavemanCMS Soon!</h2>

<p>CMS = content management system.  E.g. thing that manages content in you blog,
or site.  But they all suck.  So I am making the best CMS ever.  It's called
<em>CavemanCMS</em>.</p>

<p>Usually, existing CMS that are dynamic, e.g. those that allow you to post, and
your users to reply in somewhat real time, require you to run a dynamic web
server.  E.g. maybe FastCGI with PHP/Python, etc.  Of course, right?</p>

<p>But here is the magic:  with CavemanCMS, you shall have a fully dynamic CMS,
yet your website remains fully static.  You shall upload all you want, yet your
web server will not even need to support anything other than GET requests.</p>

<p>And it shall also be blazing fast.  Stay tuned.  This shit is awesome.  God
willing will make some noise.  Trust.</p>

<h2> How Muscle Works</h2>

<p>Below is a summary of what I have found so far:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Muscle stimulation period:</em> some site (forgot) suggested that the
growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.<p>But not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
strength, hypertrophy, etc?  Gotta search this..  Someone in YouTube said
48 hours (WTF?).  Also  <a href="https://www.nautilusplus.com/is-it-necessary-to-rest-24-hours-between-workouts/">some site</a> says 48-72 hours.</p>

</li>
<li> <em>Strength vs. Hypertrophy:</em> someone (on utube) suggested that strength
training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance by
storing more water in the muscle.
</li>
<li> <em>Number of sets:</em> someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training
is better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference
of chest and thigh).
</li>
<li> <em>Resting period between sets</em>:  <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Fulltext/2008/06000/A_Brief_Review__How_Much_Rest_between_Sets_.9.aspx">some journal</a>
suggests that optimum resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength
training, 30-90secs for hypertrophy or endurance.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Me Not Like Decoration; Here Why</h2>

<p>1st, let's define a couple of things.   <a href="#cite_smartdude1">Definition 1</a> defines what is a <em>smart</em>
dude, and  <a href="#cite_decorative2">Definition 2</a> defines what is a decorative item.</p>

<p id="cite_smartdude1" class="definition"><a href="#cite_smartdude1">Definition 1.</a> <em>A dude <span class="ignored">\(x\)</span> is said to be smart if, and only if, <span class="ignored">\(x\)</span> does stuff that
      maximize his survivability, and avoids stuff that limit him from
      maximizing his survivability.  This implies that he eats healthy food,
      learns juicy mathy sciency stuff, avoids wasting his time, etc.</em></p>

<p id="cite_decorative2" class="definition"><a href="#cite_decorative2">Definition 2.</a> <em>For a given world <span class="ignored">\(w\)</span>, a thing <span class="ignored">\(t_w\)</span> in world <span class="ignored">\(w\)</span> is said to be
      decorative if, and only if, <span class="ignored">\(t_w\)</span> does not help its owner maximize his
      survivability in world <span class="ignored">\(w\)</span>.  I.e. has no real use.  E.g. bunch of
      pretty pics hanging on the wall of your toilet.</em></p>

<p>Think a bit.  If you agree with  <a href="#cite_smartdude1">Definition 1</a> and  <a href="#cite_decorative2">Definition 2</a>, then  <a href="#cite_smartworld1">Theorem 1</a>
is true by definition.</p>

<p id="cite_smartworld1" class="theorem"><a href="#cite_smartworld1">Theorem 1.</a> <em>In a world with only smart dudes, then they will not allocate
      any resource, e.g. money/time, to make/buy decorative stuff.  i.e. no
      fancy pics hanging on walls, statues, fancy stitching on clothing, etc.
      but all resources will be used to maximize their survivability.</em></p>

<p>Based on  <a href="#cite_smartworld1">Theorem 1</a>, it's easy to see why  <a href="#cite_dumbworld2">Theorem 2</a> is also true.</p>

<p id="cite_dumbworld2" class="theorem"><a href="#cite_dumbworld2">Theorem 2.</a> <em>A world with dudes investing some resource in making/buying
      decorative items, is necessarily a world that has at least 1 non-smart
      person.</em></p>

<p>Now let's be more specific on how the world with some non-smarties, as in the
 <a href="#cite_dumbworld2">Theorem 2</a>, would look like:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Possibility 1:</em> Non-smarties are doing a mistake for making/buying
  useless stuff that don't help maximize their survivability.
</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 2:</em> Smarties make/buy decorative items because it
  happens that some non-smarties get manipulated this way more effectively for
  the selfish gains of the smarties.
</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 3:</em> A mixture of the other possibilities above.</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 4:</em> What else?  I can't find any..  This list seems
  complete, IMO.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, they are all sad cases.  I.e. either exploiting smarties, or
misguided non-smarties.  This is why I dislike decorative items: because they
seem to only reflect sad underlying realities (possibilities above are sad
cases IMO, and decorative items remind me of them).</p>
