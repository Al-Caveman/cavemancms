<h2 id="sec_1"><a href="#sec_1">1.</a> where does the ontological argument go wrong</h2>

<p>The argument starts by defining God as:</p>

<p id="cite_god"><strong><a href="#cite_god">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>God is a maximally great being.</em></p>

<p>This, by definition, implies that God exists, because maximal greatness implies
existence.  Also, &ldquo;<em>being</em>&rdquo; requires existence as far as I understand English.
So, yeah, things that are defined to exist, exist.  Duh.</p>

<p>So a better definition is:</p>

<p id="cite_godbetter"><strong><a href="#cite_godbetter">Definition 2.</a></strong> <em>God is a concept for a:
<span class="ignored">$$\begin{cases}
\text{maximally great being} & \text{ if existing}\\
\text{fictional character} & \text{ else}\\
\end{cases}$$</span></em></p>

<p>Now, good luck proving God's existence using  <a href="#cite_godbetter">Definition 2</a>.</p>

<p id="cite_notyet"><strong><a href="#cite_notyet">Note 1.</a></strong> <em>This doesn't mean that &mdash;God forbid&mdash; God doesn't exist.  It just means
      that the ontological argument is pointless.  There is still a lot of good
      reasons to follow God's path.  IMO God's path is the best path to follow.</em></p>

<h3 id="sec_2.2"><a href="#sec_2.2">2.2.</a> my attempt after  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a>'s footsteps</h3>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a> didn't define what's positive.  I dunno why.  IMO it's easy to show
what's <em>positive</em> by linking it to <em>good</em> as I did earlier<sup><a href="#fn_detailselsewhere">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p id="cite_positive"><strong><a href="#cite_positive">Definition 6.</a></strong> <em>A property <span class="ignored">$b$</span> is positive if it's good for <span class="ignored">$x$</span>.</em></p>

<p id="cite_good"><strong><a href="#cite_good">Definition 7.</a></strong> <em>A property <span class="ignored">$b$</span> is good for <span class="ignored">$x$</span> if helps maximizing <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s
           survivability<sup><a href="#fn_detailselsewhere">2</a></sup>.</em></p>

<p>Welp&hellip; by  <a href="#cite_godlike">Definition 3</a>,  <a href="#cite_positive">Definition 6</a> and  <a href="#cite_good">Definition 7</a>, God exists by, welp, definition.
Since survivability <em>is</em> existence &mdash;  Q.E.D.</p>

<p>So, as you see,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a>'s path is kinda boring.  The moment he <em>defines</em> God to
be all-positive, is the moment he defines God to exist.  So all that dance that
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Gödel</a> did is kinda weasely IMO.</p>

<h2 id="sec_3"><a href="#sec_3">3.</a> how is the simulator?</h2>

<p>As you might have already heard,  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/">we <em>might</em> be in a simulation</a> right now.  In this column I
describe a test that lays the foundation for a principled approach to estimate
properties about the parent existence that is simulating us!</p>

<p>The shit herein is <em>pretty dope</em> and opens new gates to a whole new class of
observatories.  If you think that the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)</a> was <em>freaking</em> cool, then my shit
herein is <em>OMG mega freaking dope cool</em> cool.</p>

<h3 id="sec_3.1"><a href="#sec_3.1">3.1.</a> how many nested simulations?</h3>

<p>IMO, our universe could be simulated in a parent universe, and latter could be
itself simulated in a grand parent universe, etc.  Look at  <a href="#cite_7skies">Figure 1</a>&hellip; some
ancient dudes had some related thoughts.</p>

<figure id="cite_7skies" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Seven paradises" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Mohammed%C2%B4s_Paradise.jpg/220px-Mohammed%C2%B4s_Paradise.jpg" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_7skies">Figure 1.</a></strong> Was dude thinking of simulations?</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="sec_3.2"><a href="#sec_3.2">3.2.</a> what to know about it?</h3>

<p>IMO, universes that end up simulating other universes, probably must be sharing
something common between them.  After all, they are the universes that ended up
simulating others.</p>

<p>So, IMO, if we:</p>

<ol>
<li> Simulate many universes, each initialized with randomized physics laws.  So
  each universe seems independent from each other, and our universe.</li>
<li> Wait to see which ones end up simulating other universes.</li>
<li> Look at those that are simulating other universes, and see if they share
  unique patterns that non-simulating universes lack.</li>
</ol>
<p>I mean, imagine if almost all universes that we simulate, that themselves end
up simulating others, share some common properties that is only unique among
them (but not among universes that don't simulate other universes), won't you
then feel that our parent universe is probably more likely to also have those
properties?  After all it is also one that has simulated another universe (our
universe).</p>

<h3 id="sec_3.3"><a href="#sec_3.3">3.3.</a> problems</h3>

<p>We probably can't simulate a rat's ass these days, so all this is wishful
thinking that, one day, when computers are powerful enough, we might have
better guesses about how might our parent universe be.</p>

<p>But there is certain amount of badass-ness that our universe can't simulate.
E.g. our universe can't simulate a universe that can solve problems that are
not solvable by Turing machines.</p>

<p>But, still, if we do these simulations, we can possibly end up updating our
probability model about our parent universe's properties.  Currently, we know
nothing.  But after those simulations, maybe we could say &ldquo;<em>welp.. probably it
has X!</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="sec_4"><a href="#sec_4">4.</a> what is <em>good</em>?</h2>

<p>When people debate, they often say things like: <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is good, <span class="ignored">$y$</span> is not
good, why is <span class="ignored">$z$</span> good? Etc.  Yet rarely ever they discuss the fundamental
question: what is <em>good</em> itself? Based on what criteria a thing becomes good?</p>

<p>It is logically impossible for two people to <em>meaningfully</em> debate whether
<span class="ignored">$x$</span> is good, while them having different definitions of <em>good</em>.  If they ever
conclude something correctly, it must be thanks to the amount of sheer dumb
luck that accidentally served them.  As a result, <span class="ignored">$99.99\%$</span><sup><a href="#fn_assnumber">3</a></sup> of all
debates are useless and cyclic.</p>

<p>To cut the chase short, here is what I think is the <em>best</em> definition of
<em>good</em>:</p>

<p id="cite_defgood"><strong><a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 8.</a></strong> <em>A thing <span class="ignored">$t$</span> is good for <span class="ignored">$x$</span> if <span class="ignored">$t$</span> maximizes <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s
              survivabiliy.</em></p>

<p> <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 8</a> has these nice properties:</p>

<ul>
<li> It can be <em>objectively</em> measured!  We can use statistics, biology, etc, to
    measure expected values of how <em>good</em> a thing is!</li>
<li> All other definitions of <em>good</em> are all dependant on <em>survivability
    maximization</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't believe me?  Let's look at other definitions:</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood1"><strong><a href="#cite_pplgood1">Quote 1:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Common sense dictates what is good.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Dude McDudeface</cite></footer></figure>

<p>The <em>common sense</em> that is proposed in  <a href="#cite_pplgood1">Quote 1</a> depends on the biological
configuration of the people that their <em>common sense</em> is analyzed.  The
biological configuration, <em>itself</em>, is a function of <em>evolution</em>.  As you know,
evolution makes use of <em>natural selection</em>, which rewards patterns that have
higher survivability.</p>

<p>I know evolution itself is not a confirmed fact, but a mere guess.  But come on
dude.. it's the best guess we have now.  Do you have any better guess?</p>

<p>Therefore, IMO it's fair to say that common sense <em>itself</em> is nothing but a
mere parameter that is tweaked by evolution to achieve a higher survivability
maximization of the species at hand (in this case humans).  See! It came back
to  <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 8</a>!</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood2"><strong><a href="#cite_pplgood2">Quote 2:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Good is whatever that makes me feel happy.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Faggot McFilth</cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_pplgood2">Quote 2</a> has the same inadequacy problem that  <a href="#cite_pplgood1">Quote 1</a> suffers.
Eventually, the <em>happiness</em> feeling, itself, is also a mere parameter that was
tweaked throught the ages, due to evolution, in order to allow mankind to
survive better.  As you can see, happiness itself seems to be a <em>proxy</em> that
reflects survivability maximization.  Again.. back to  <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 8</a>!</p>

<figure id="cite_pplgood3"><strong><a href="#cite_pplgood3">Quote 3:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;But what if happiness is not a function of evolution, but rather a
           function of soul/spirits from another world?&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Nagger McNugget</cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_pplgood3">Quote 3</a> is possibly true,  but, we can't measure/test souls/spirits, or
things beyong the measurable world.  Therefore, while  <a href="#cite_pplgood3">Quote 3</a> might be true,
we can't use it to verify any hypotheses.  As a result, I suggest that it is
perhaps better to not define <em>good</em> based on it.</p>

<p>So.. this leaves us with  <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 8</a> as the the most general/basic measurable
definition so far.  What do you think?  Can you find any better definition than
 <a href="#cite_defgood">Definition 8</a>?</p>

<h2 id="sec_5"><a href="#sec_5">5.</a> cavemark is out!</h2>

<p>CavemanCMS, and all articles in this website, currently use  <a href="https://github.com/al-caveman/cavemark">CaveMark</a> as their
markdown parser.  Neat <span class="ignored">$\LaTeX$</span>-like formatting with little effort!</p>

<p>CaveMark is nice because it:</p>

<ol>
<li> Follows typesetting principles.</li>
<li> Is the
fastest<sup><a href="#fn_clarifyspeed">4</a></sup> pure-Python markdown parser around.  It easily beats
 <a href="https://github.com/lepture/mistune">mistune</a> in CPython3:<p><pre><code>mistune : 18.17786209 seconds
cavemark: 9.386662586 seconds (1.9 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<p>in CPython2:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 19.72612286 seconds
cavemark: 9.484875202 seconds (2.1 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<p>in PyPy3:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 12.31156345 seconds
cavemark: 3.191607327 seconds (3.9 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<p>and in PyPy2:</p>

<p><pre><code>mistune : 8.993317127 seconds
cavemark: 1.470407009 seconds (6.1 times faster!)</code></pre></p>

<h2 id="sec_6"><a href="#sec_6">6.</a> cavemancms soon!</h2>

<p>CMS = content management system.  E.g. thing that manages content in you blog,
or site.  But they all suck.  So I am making the best CMS ever.  It's called
<em>CavemanCMS</em>.</p>

<p>Usually, existing CMS that are dynamic, e.g. those that allow you to post, and
your users to reply in somewhat real time, require you to run a dynamic web
server.  E.g. maybe FastCGI with PHP/Python, etc.  Of course, right?</p>

<p>But here is the magic:  with CavemanCMS, you shall have a fully dynamic CMS,
yet your website remains fully static.  You shall upload all you want, yet your
web server will not even need to support anything other than GET requests.</p>

<p>And it shall also be blazing fast.  Stay tuned.  This shit is awesome.  God
willing will make some noise.  Trust.</p>

<h2 id="sec_7"><a href="#sec_7">7.</a> how muscle works</h2>

<p>Below is a summary of what I have found so far:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Muscle stimulation period:</em> some site (forgot) suggested that the
growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.<p>But not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
strength, hypertrophy, etc?  Gotta search this..  Someone in YouTube said
48 hours (WTF?).  Also  <a href="https://www.nautilusplus.com/is-it-necessary-to-rest-24-hours-between-workouts/">some site</a> says 48-72 hours.</p>

</li>
<li> <em>Strength vs. Hypertrophy:</em> someone (on utube) suggested that strength
training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance by
storing more water in the muscle.
</li>
<li> <em>Number of sets:</em> someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training
is better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference
of chest and thigh).
</li>
<li> <em>Resting period between sets</em>:  <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Fulltext/2008/06000/A_Brief_Review__How_Much_Rest_between_Sets_.9.aspx">some journal</a>
suggests that optimum resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength
training, 30-90secs for hypertrophy or endurance.</li>
</ul>

<article>
<h2 id="sec_8"><a href="#sec_8">8.</a> me not like decoration; here why</h2>

<p>1st, let's define a couple of things.   <a href="#cite_smartdude">Definition 9</a> defines what is a <em>smart</em>
dude, and  <a href="#cite_decorative">Definition 10</a> defines what is a decorative item.</p>

<p id="cite_smartdude"><strong><a href="#cite_smartdude">Definition 9.</a></strong> <em>A dude <span class="ignored">$x$</span> is said to be smart if, and only if, <span class="ignored">$x$</span> does stuff that
      maximize his survivability, and avoids stuff that limit him from
      maximizing his survivability.  This implies that he eats healthy food,
      learns juicy mathy sciency stuff, avoids wasting his time, etc.</em></p>

<p id="cite_decorative"><strong><a href="#cite_decorative">Definition 10.</a></strong> <em>For a given world <span class="ignored">$w$</span>, a thing <span class="ignored">$t_w$</span> in world <span class="ignored">$w$</span> is said to be
      decorative if, and only if, <span class="ignored">$t_w$</span> does not help its owner maximize his
      survivability in world <span class="ignored">$w$</span>.  I.e. has no real use.  E.g. bunch of
      pretty pics hanging on the wall of your toilet.</em></p>

<p>Think a bit.  If you agree with  <a href="#cite_smartdude">Definition 9</a> and  <a href="#cite_decorative">Definition 10</a>, then  <a href="#cite_smartworld">Theorem 3</a>
is true by definition.</p>

<p id="cite_smartworld"><strong><a href="#cite_smartworld">Theorem 3.</a></strong> <em>In a world with only smart dudes, then they will not allocate
      any resource, e.g. money/time, to make/buy decorative stuff.  i.e. no
      fancy pics hanging on walls, statues, fancy stitching on clothing, etc.
      but all resources will be used to maximize their survivability.</em></p>

<p>Based on  <a href="#cite_smartworld">Theorem 3</a>, it's easy to see why  <a href="#cite_dumbworld">Theorem 4</a> is also true.</p>

<p id="cite_dumbworld"><strong><a href="#cite_dumbworld">Theorem 4.</a></strong> <em>A world with dudes investing some resource in making/buying
      decorative items, is necessarily a world that has at least 1 non-smart
      person.</em></p>

<p>Now let's be more specific on how the world with some non-smarties, as in the
 <a href="#cite_dumbworld">Theorem 4</a>, would look like:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Possibility 1:</em> Non-smarties are doing a mistake for making/buying
  useless stuff that don't help maximize their survivability.
</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 2:</em> Smarties make/buy decorative items because it
  happens that some non-smarties get manipulated this way more effectively for
  the selfish gains of the smarties.
</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 3:</em> A mixture of the other possibilities above.</li>
<li> <em>Possibility 4:</em> What else?  I can't find any..  This list seems
  complete, IMO.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, they are all sad cases.  I.e. either exploiting smarties, or
misguided non-smarties.  This is why I dislike decorative items: because they
seem to only reflect sad underlying realities (possibilities above are sad
cases IMO, and decorative items remind me of them).</p>
