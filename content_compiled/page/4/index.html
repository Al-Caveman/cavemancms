<h2 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete">1.</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative">categorical imperative</a> is obsolete</h2>

<p>I just wanna say that  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative">categorical imperative</a>:</p>

<p id="cite_thecategoricalimp"><strong><a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1.</a></strong> <em>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time,
      will that it should become a universal law.</em></p>

<p>is obsoleted by my superior alternative:</p>

<p id="cite_dogood"><strong><a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2.</a></strong> <em>Do what is  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">good</a> for humanity.</em></p>

<p><em>Why?</em> you may ask.  Bcoz <em>simpler</em> and <em>correcter</em>.  The <em>simpler</em> is maybe
easy to see, but why <em>correcter</em>?</p>

<h3 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete.1"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete.1">1.1.</a> suicide case</h3>

<p> <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a> is correcter than  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a> because former is much more
objective than the latter.  E.g. with  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a> a suicidal person may
say &ldquo;<em>Welp&hellip; I'm OK to be killed, therefore it is also OK for me to kill
others</em>&rdquo;.  This problem does not exist in  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a>.</p>

<p>But  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a> knew of that suicide issue and proposed a solution<sup><a href="#fn___1">1</a></sup>.  So  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#Suicide">he added a special case</a>
to handle the suicide.  IMO he is basically adding the exception &ldquo;<em>let's also
not get extinct!</em>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn___2">2</a></sup> &mdash; my
 <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a> handles this issue cleanly without needing to add any special case!</p>

<h3 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete.2"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete.2">1.2.</a> fancy facility case</h3>

<p>Here is another example beyond the suicide case earlier where my  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a>
trumps  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li> I want to build a massive research facility that will help humanity do some
  really advanced research to save humanity.</li>
<li> But this facility is soooOoOo big that there can be only one of its kind on
  Earth.  If any one else tried to build another facility of this kind, it will
  harm the functionality of the other.  It's some kind of advanced research.</li>
<li> This means I will want to build this good facility, yet at the same time not
  want anyone else to build a similar facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s  <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a>, it will be <em>immoral</em> of me if I created
that obviously good research facility!  IMO this shows a limitation in
 <a href="#cite_thecategoricalimp">Rule 1</a>.</p>

<p>While my  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a> does not suffer from any of those exceptions.
As you see, my shit is simpler and better than  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a>'s shit.</p>

<h3 id="kants_shit_is_obsolete.3"><a class="hindex" href="#kants_shit_is_obsolete.3">1.3.</a> why didn't  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</a> see  <a href="#cite_dogood">Rule 2</a>?</h3>

<p>Maybe in part because he was from the 1700s, while evolution came later IMO
since  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</a> is an 1800s dude.  This matters because it relates to how I
define  <a href="https://cave.mn/page/2/#what_is_good">good</a>.</p>

<h2 id="God_extends_optimization_scope"><a class="hindex" href="#God_extends_optimization_scope">2.</a> God extends our optimization scope</h2>

<p id="cite_very_long_term_proj_def"><strong><a href="#cite_very_long_term_proj_def">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>A project <span class="ignored">$p$</span> is said to be &ldquo;a very long-term project&rdquo; if, and only
           if, founder of <span class="ignored">$p$</span>, i.e. dude <span class="ignored">$x$</span>, knows that <span class="ignored">$p$</span> will be profitable
           only after <span class="ignored">$x$</span>'s death.</em></p>

<p id="cite_god_extends_optimization_scope"><strong><a href="#cite_god_extends_optimization_scope">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>The probability of having person <span class="ignored">$x$</span> found a very long-term project is
        higher when person <span class="ignored">$x$</span> believes in a fair God, than the alternative
        case where <span class="ignored">$x$</span> doesn't.</em></p>

<h3 id="God_extends_optimization_scope.1"><a class="hindex" href="#God_extends_optimization_scope.1">2.1.</a>  <a href="#cite_god_extends_optimization_scope">Theorem 1</a>'s proof</h3>

<p>IMO if a person doesn't believe in God, then &mdash;logically speaking&mdash; his
<em>brain</em> has no reason to justify investing effort in any long-term project that
will only profit after person's death.  His <em>brain</em> will only accept investing
in projects that will be profitable during his lifespan.</p>

<p>The only way to get your <em>brain</em> to accept that investing in such long-term
projects is a good idea, is to have some kind of punishments/rewards system
that will apply to you after your death&mdash;AKA a fair God.</p>

<p>There you go:  on advantage of believing in a fair God is that it makes your
<em>brain</em> accept investing in long-term projects that would benefit humanity in
the long run, even though you might be alive to see that day.</p>

<p>The only way a Godless person can do that is by having his <em>feelings</em> push him
to care about past his death (but not his <em>brain</em>).  Worse, such <em>feelings</em>
would always face resistance from the <em>brain</em>.</p>

<p>But, a Godly person would have his <em>brain</em> and <em>feelings</em> in agreement about
investments in positive long-term projects that benefit humanity, because the
believe in the fair God implies a fair reward even after one's death.</p>

<p id="cite_godmightbereal"><strong><a href="#cite_godmightbereal">Note 2.</a></strong> <em>Even though this column discussed God from an atheist's perspective, it
     does not mean that God is unreal.  It just means that even an atheist
     should find a reason to appreciate believe in God&mdash;unless he is suicidal
     and doesn't care about humanity's survivability.</em></p>

<h2 id="sodom"><a class="hindex" href="#sodom">3.</a> sodom and gomorrah</h2>

<p>They mainly only had an I/O problem as they kept plugging output devices into
other output devices.</p>

<p>But they were pretty real people, in a sense that they didn't chop their balls
to make fake vags, nor that they wore pants with fake pockets, or shirts with
fake zippers.</p>

<p>Compared to today's standards<sup><a href="#fn___3">3</a></sup>, they were pretty
conservative faggots.  But, still,  <a href="#cite_sodompunish">Figure 1</a> happened to them.</p>

<figure id="cite_sodompunish" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Sodom/Gomorrah got served" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/John_Martin_-_Sodom_and_Gomorrah.jpg/300px-John_Martin_-_Sodom_and_Gomorrah.jpg" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_sodompunish">Figure 1.</a></strong> Sodom and Gamorrah getting their ass kicked bcoz of their persistent

<p>IMO today's  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk14dShQMlY">trash people</a> are far worse than Sodom and Gamorrah.</p>

<h2 id="dukkha_workout_routine"><a class="hindex" href="#dukkha_workout_routine">4.</a> the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">Dukkha</a> routine</h2>

<p>I propose to you the <em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">Dukkha</a> routine</em> &mdash; a workout routine tailored
specifically for the needs of the modern man of the <span class="ignored">$21^{st}$</span> century.</p>

<h3 id="dukkha_workout_routine.1"><a class="hindex" href="#dukkha_workout_routine.1">4.1.</a> advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li> Can be done in many places as it requires very few tools.</li>
<li> Can be done by busy people as it requires only 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li> Covers most of your muscles, and leads proportional muscle growth.  In about
  a month of following this routine, my cold-flexed biceps got bigger by 1
  inch &mdash; This Shit Works&trade;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dukkha_workout_routine.2"><a class="hindex" href="#dukkha_workout_routine.2">4.2.</a> resources needed</h3>

<ul>
<li> 1 dumbbell.</li>
<li> Something horizontal to hang on to do pull-ups.</li>
<li> 2 circular ropes to hang on the horizontal thing to do the suspension dips.</li>
<li> 10 to 15 minutes max.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dukkha_workout_routine.3"><a class="hindex" href="#dukkha_workout_routine.3">4.3.</a> the routine</h3>

<ul>
<li> Pull-ups.</li>
<li> Chin-ups.</li>
<li> Forward-leaning Suspension dips.</li>
<li> Straight-up Suspension dips.</li>
<li> Suspension leg lift, up till your torso also curls (not only leg lift).</li>
<li> Side moving planks.</li>
<li> Single-legged squat, with full leg extension up to a point where you also
  extend your feet (i.e. single-legged standing calf raise).</li>
<li> Shoulder press.</li>
<li> Chest-pull.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dukkha_workout_routine.4"><a class="hindex" href="#dukkha_workout_routine.4">4.4.</a> repetition</h3>

<p>The repetition of each workout item in the routine should be maximum possible
(to failure), given the following constraint:  <em>must not exceed 10</em>.  Ideally,
aim for 5 as the max (if you have enough weight around to achieve that).</p>

<p>If you find yourself able to exceed 10, then add extra weights so that you end
up failing no later than the 10th repetition.  E.g. if you can do more than 10
pull-ups, then hold a dumbbell with your legs so that you fail by the 10th
repetition.</p>

<h3 id="dukkha_workout_routine.5"><a class="hindex" href="#dukkha_workout_routine.5">4.5.</a> daily nutrition</h3>

<ul>
<li> 1 serving of multi-vitamin pills.  Let's get real, most of us don't have much
  time to eat diverse-enough set of fruits.</li>
<li> An amount of proteins as suggested by the  <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">TDEE Calculator</a>,
  given the constraint that the total calories does not exceed what's also
  suggested by  <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">it</a>.</li>
<li> Drink a good amount of water.</li>
</ul>
