<h2 id="allahu_ackbar"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar">1.</a> allahu ackbar</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Allahu ackbar</em>&rdquo; &mdash; is something about to blow up?   <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/truck-of-peace">Truck of
peace</a> again?  &mdash; more on this later.  But for now, what does it mean?</p>

<figure id="cite_allahuackbar" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="An energetic alien, sporting beard, next to a board with &ldquo;Allahu
         ackbar&ldquo; written on it." src="/pics/allahuackbar.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_allahuackbar">Figure 1.</a></strong> Allahu ackbar.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="allahu_ackbar.1"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar.1">1.1.</a> meaning</h3>

<ul>
<li> The trailing <em>u</em> in <em>Allahu</em> is only a vowel that serves a grammatical
  purpose.  The noun is <em>Allah</em> &mdash; <em>الله</em> in Arabic without the <em>u</em>-sounding
  vowel, <em>اللهُ</em> with the the vowel.<p><em>Allah</em> is literally <em>God</em> in Arabic, with the capital letter <em>G</em>.  Is it
  only Muslims' God?  Certainly not.</p>

<p>Allah is also used by Arab Christians.  In fact, <em>Allah</em> is in the Arabic
  translation of the Bible whenever God is referred as shown in
   <a href="#cite_quotearabgenesis">Quote 3</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_quotearabgenesis"><strong><a href="#cite_quotearabgenesis">Quote 3:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;فِي الْبَدْءِ خَلَقَ اللهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالارْضَ&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Genesis 1:1,  <a href="http://www.copticchurch.net/cgibin/bible/index.php?version=SVD&r=Genesis+1">Coptic Orthodox Arabic Bible</a></cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_quotearabgenesis">Quote 3</a>'s translation in English is:</p>

<p></p>

<figure id="cite_quoteengenesis"><strong><a href="#cite_quoteengenesis">Quote 4:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth..&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Genesis 1:1,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">any English Bible</a>.</cite></footer></figure>

<p>You can use a translator to verify that <em>الله</em> is referring to <em>God</em>.</p>

</li>
<li> <em>Ackbar</em> just means <em>greater</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the string <em>Allahu ackbar</em> means <em>God is greater</em>, which &mdash;perhaps&mdash; you
knew.  But IMO you didn't know that <em>Allah</em> is literally the name of the same
Biblical God that Arab Christians use.</p>

<p>So, before you say that <em>Allah = Satan</em>, put in your mind that this also refers
to Arab christians' God as well.</p>

<h3 id="allahu_ackbar.2"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar.2">1.2.</a> usage and function</h3>

<p>Usage &mdash; IMO usually if someone is facing hardship, the person reminds himself
that God is greater [than the cause of the hardship], so that he
perseveres<sup><a href="#fn___9">1</a></sup> and hopefully wins the greater reward: success now, heavens later, or
both.</p>

<p>Function &mdash; IMO offers the believer psychological support to allow him to
contain himself better at times of hardship, without needing to drink
alcohol<sup><a href="#fn___10">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="allahu_ackbar.3"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar.3">1.3.</a> <s>terrorism</s> crime</h3>

<p>Those behind  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">9/11</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Berlin_truck_attack">Berlin's truck attack</a>, etc, are murderers
and as per God's order, both Quranically and Biblically, should get the capital
punishment:</p>

<figure id="cite_quranmurder"><strong><a href="#cite_quranmurder">Quote 5:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;And whoever is killed unjustly, We have (already) appointed to his
          patron authority. So let him not exceed (Literally: be extravagant)
          in killing; surely he will be vindicated.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Quran 17:33,  <a href="https://quran.com/17/33">Dr. Ghali's translation</a></cite></footer></figure>

<figure id="cite_genesis96"><strong><a href="#cite_genesis96">Quote 6:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
          the image of God made he man.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Genesis 9:6,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">KJV</a></cite></footer></figure>

<p>Some skeptic's may pick on the word <em>unjustly</em> in  <a href="#cite_quranmurder">Quote 5</a>, but I tell you
this:  no key Islamic scholar ever called murder of civilian innocents,
regardless of faith, justice, including the grand Mufti of Saudi.  In fact, all
of the key scholars agree that their kill is murder and unjust.</p>

<p>Some ask:  what about <em>ISIS = Islamic State &hellip; something</em>?  I say fook ISIS.
They violate Islam and are basically a mercenary group in a proxy war between
USA and Russia.  IMO ISIS follows an Islamic <em>theme</em> only to attract fighters
since it is operating in a Muslim majority country.</p>

<p>If ISIS puts <em>Islamic</em> in their name, but violate Islam, then this doesn't make
them Islamic, but rather <em>liars</em>.</p>

<p>Some sites, such as <em>www.thereligionofpeace.com</em> spread mistranslations, and
misquotations out of context, of the Quran, and wrongly claim that Quran
promotes killing non-believers.  This is false.  All fighting verses in Quran
are in defensive wars where non-Muslims were attacking Muslims in a war.</p>

<h2 id="imo_music_not_good"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good">2.</a> imo music is not good</h2>

<p>Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:</p>

<ul>
<li> That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.  Now the next question is:</p>

<p id="cite_whyneedmusic"><strong><a href="#cite_whyneedmusic">Question 1.</a></strong> <em>Why do you need that information?</em></p>

<p>and its answer:</p>

<p id="cite_studyingretards"><strong><a href="#cite_studyingretards">Answer 1.</a></strong> <em>Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.</em></p>

<p>So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!</p>

<p>Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:</p>

<ul>
<li> Weakens your ear drums.</li>
<li> Induces bias to your brain's activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <em>drums</em> damage point, evolution-wise, we are more evolved to handle
sounds found in nature, as opposed to sounds produced by musical instruments.
This may explain why music is more harmful to our ears than natural sounds.</p>

<p>But what do I mean by the <em>bias</em> shit?  Basically music IMO alters how you
think.  E.g. depending on the music you listen, you may end up being more
risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not good, because it induces some
artificial bias in your brain's function as shown in  <a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_biasvariance" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Some shooting targets showing the bias-variance trade-off." src="https://cave.mn/pics/bias-variance-tradeoff.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 2.</a></strong> Bias-variance trade-off.</figcaption></figure>

<p>IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.</p>

<h3 id="imo_music_not_good.1"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good.1">2.1.</a> criticism</h3>

<p>Some people disagree with me and say that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">music can make people
smarter</a>.  But IMO  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> has a fundamental flaw: the alternative
to music classes for kids were <em>drama lessons</em> and <em>nothing</em>.  They didn't
include, say, <em>mathematics</em> classes as an alternative.</p>

<p>This is why  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> is shit: maybe the reason the kids that learned
music became smarter was thanks to them needing to learn musical notes (those
fancy symbols for music) which functions as some kind of programming (except
for generating sound).</p>

<p>In other words, if the kids had taken a <em>programming</em> class, or extra
<em>mathematics</em> classes, then maybe they would have been even smarter, without
having the side effect of musical instruments possibly damaging their ears.</p>

<p>IMO it's disgusting that the study claims it's due to music that kids became
smarter, and not because of the abstract mathematical and logical aspects of
generating music, which &mdash;itself&mdash; is not music.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410500342542">This other study</a> says that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">that study</a> is shit, but then
adds its own shit by doing similar wrong shit.  One funny aspect it mentions
that music is good to calm retards.  See&hellip; I LITERALLY told you music is for
retards!</p>
