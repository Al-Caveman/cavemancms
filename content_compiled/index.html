<h2 id="blindfolded_faggot_thought_experiment"><a class="hindex" href="#blindfolded_faggot_thought_experiment">1.</a> the blindfolded faggot thought
experiment</h2>

<p>This is a thought experiment to investigate what makes a faggot, faggot.
Consider the following scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li> <em>Group 1</em> &mdash; A blindfoldeded faggot is given a butt, without knowing whose
  butt is that.  The faggot is lied to that butt is a female's butt in reality.
  He f***s the butt, then rates it from 1 to 5 (1 is bad, 5 is good).
</li>
<li> <em>Group 2</em> &mdash; Same, but the faggot is told the truth that it's a female's
  butt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine we randomly sample 100 faggots from Amsterdam's faggot pride rally, and
randomly assign 50 of them to <em>Group 1</em> and the other 50 to <em>Group 2</em> &mdash; what
do you think will happen?</p>

<p>On average, I bet they will say this:</p>

<ul>
<li> Faggots of <em>Group 1</em> would say &ldquo;<em>OMG BEST MALE BUTT EVER 5/5!!</em>&rdquo;.</li>
<li> Faggots of <em>Group 2</em> would say &ldquo;<em>No.  0/5.  Can't even have an erection.  We
  are born faggots don't you know?</em>&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably agree.  Because, <em>I guess</em>, a male's anus is the same as female's.
Maybe a female's anus is like a 10 years old boy's anus<sup><a href="#fn___10">1</a></sup>? This is also why faggots are also crypto pedos.</p>

<p>Here is what I think the thought experiment implies:</p>

<ol>
<li> Technically, <em>in the thought experiment</em>, the faggot is fucking the anus, not
  the butt, not the legs.</li>
<li> The reason a faggot appreciates an anus that's attached to a man's butt is
  because of the <em>context</em> around the anus.  E.g. attached to a hairy man's ass
  that's attached to a face with shaved beard.</li>
<li> Such context information is a very high-level information.</li>
<li> High-level context-information is IMO processed by the brain.</li>
<li> IMO neural activity about context information is by far mostly influenced by
  the past memory, or environment, than (say) genes.</li>
<li> Therefore, the primary contributor in the making of a faggot is the
  environment, and not the genes (genes might be only a marginal/secondary
  cause).</li>
</ol>
<p id="cite_faggotenv"><strong><a href="#cite_faggotenv">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>Environment is the main factor in the making of a faggot.</em></p>

<h2 id="allahu_ackbar"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar">2.</a> allahu ackbar</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Allahu ackbar</em>&rdquo; &mdash; is something about to blow up?   <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/truck-of-peace">Truck of
peace</a> again?  More on this later.  But for now, what does it mean?</p>

<figure id="cite_allahuackbar" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="An energetic alien, sporting beard, next to a board with &ldquo;Allahu
         ackbar&ldquo; written on it." src="/pics/allahuackbar.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_allahuackbar">Figure 1.</a></strong> Allahu ackbar.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="allahu_ackbar.1"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar.1">2.1.</a> meaning</h3>

<ul>
<li> <em>Allahu</em> &mdash; The trailing <em>u</em> in <em>Allahu</em> is only a vowel that serves a
  grammatical purpose.  The noun is <em>Allah</em> &mdash; <em>الله</em> in Arabic without the
  <em>u</em>-sounding vowel, <em>اللهُ</em> with the the vowel.<p><em>Allah</em> is literally <em>God</em> in Arabic, with the capital letter <em>G</em>.  Is it
  only Muslims' God?  Certainly not.</p>

<p>Allah is also used by Arab Christians.  In fact, <em>Allah</em> is in the Arabic
  translation of the Bible whenever God is referred as shown in
   <a href="#cite_quotearabgenesis">Quote 3</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_quotearabgenesis"><strong><a href="#cite_quotearabgenesis">Quote 3:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;فِي الْبَدْءِ خَلَقَ اللهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالارْضَ&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Genesis 1:1,  <a href="http://www.copticchurch.net/cgibin/bible/index.php?version=SVD&r=Genesis+1"> SVD (most popular Arabic Bible)</a></cite></footer></figure>

<p> <a href="#cite_quotearabgenesis">Quote 3</a>'s translation in English is:</p>

<p></p>

<figure id="cite_quoteengenesis"><strong><a href="#cite_quoteengenesis">Quote 4:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth..&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Genesis 1:1,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">any English Bible</a>.</cite></footer></figure>

<p>You can use a translator to verify that <em>الله</em> is referring to <em>God</em>.</p>

</li>
<li> <em>Ackbar</em> &mdash; just means <em>greater</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the string <em>Allahu ackbar</em> means <em>God is greater</em>, which &mdash;perhaps&mdash; you
knew.  But IMO you didn't know that <em>Allah</em> is literally the name of the same
Biblical God that Arab Christians use.</p>

<p>So, before you say that <em>Allah = Satan</em>, plz put in your mind that this also
refers to the God of Arab Christians as well.  Then, after you put this in your
mind, you may still say it, but at least knowing what you are saying.</p>

<h3 id="allahu_ackbar.2"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar.2">2.2.</a> usage and function</h3>

<p>Usage &mdash; IMO usually if someone is facing hardship, the person reminds himself
that God is greater [than the cause of the hardship], so that he
perseveres<sup><a href="#fn___11">2</a></sup> and hopefully wins the greater reward: success now, heavens later, or
both.</p>

<p>Function &mdash; IMO offers the believer psychological support to allow him to
contain himself better at times of hardship, without needing to drink
piss<sup><a href="#fn___12">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="allahu_ackbar.3"><a class="hindex" href="#allahu_ackbar.3">2.3.</a> <s>terrorism</s> crime</h3>

<p>Those behind  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">9/11</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Berlin_truck_attack">Berlin's truck attack</a>, etc, are murderers
and as per God's order, both Quranically and Biblically, should get the capital
punishment:</p>

<figure id="cite_quranmurder"><strong><a href="#cite_quranmurder">Quote 5:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;And whoever is killed unjustly, We have (already) appointed to his
          patron authority. So let him not exceed (Literally: be extravagant)
          in killing; surely he will be vindicated.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Quran 17:33,  <a href="https://quran.com/17/33">Dr. Ghali's translation</a></cite></footer></figure>

<figure id="cite_genesis96"><strong><a href="#cite_genesis96">Quote 6:</a></strong><blockquote><em>&ldquo;Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
          the image of God made he man.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><footer style="text-align:right;">&mdash; <cite>Genesis 9:6,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">KJV</a></cite></footer></figure>

<p>Some may pick on the word <em>unjustly</em> in  <a href="#cite_quranmurder">Quote 5</a>, but IMO  no key Islamic
scholar ever called murder of civilian innocents, regardless of faith, justice,
including the grand Mufti of Saudi.  In fact, all of the key scholars agree
that their kill is murder and unjust.</p>

<p>What about the name <em>ISIS = Islamic State &hellip; something</em>?  IMO, obviously, name
itself doesn't imply function.  E.g. I can call an apple a banana instead, but
it won't become a banana.  So, IMO, if ISIS violates Islamic rules, but calls
itself Islamic, then IMO this rather make them liars &mdash; which might not be
surprising given their political involvement in the proxy war that is in Syria.</p>

<h2 id="imo_music_not_good"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good">3.</a> imo music is not good</h2>

<p>Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:</p>

<ul>
<li> That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.  Now the next question is:</p>

<p id="cite_whyneedmusic"><strong><a href="#cite_whyneedmusic">Question 1.</a></strong> <em>Why do you need that information?</em></p>

<p>and its answer:</p>

<p id="cite_studyingretards"><strong><a href="#cite_studyingretards">Answer 1.</a></strong> <em>Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.</em></p>

<p>So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!</p>

<p>Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:</p>

<ul>
<li> Weakens your ear drums.</li>
<li> Induces bias to your brain's activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <em>drums</em> damage point, evolution-wise, we are more evolved to handle
sounds found in nature, as opposed to sounds produced by musical instruments.
This may explain why music is more harmful to our ears than natural sounds.</p>

<p>But what do I mean by the <em>bias</em> shit?  Basically music IMO alters how you
think.  E.g. depending on the music you listen, you may end up being more
risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not good, because it induces some
artificial bias in your brain's function as shown in  <a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_biasvariance" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Some shooting targets showing the bias-variance trade-off." src="https://cave.mn/pics/bias-variance-tradeoff.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 2.</a></strong> Bias-variance trade-off.</figcaption></figure>

<p>IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.</p>

<h3 id="imo_music_not_good.1"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good.1">3.1.</a> criticism</h3>

<p>Some people disagree with me and say that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">music can make people
smarter</a>.  But IMO  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> has a fundamental flaw: the alternative
to music classes for kids were <em>drama lessons</em> and <em>nothing</em>.  They didn't
include, say, <em>mathematics</em> classes as an alternative.</p>

<p>This is why  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> is shit: maybe the reason the kids that learned
music became smarter was thanks to them needing to learn musical notes (those
fancy symbols for music) which functions as some kind of programming (except
for generating sound).</p>

<p>In other words, if the kids had taken a <em>programming</em> class, or extra
<em>mathematics</em> classes, then maybe they would have been even smarter, without
having the side effect of musical instruments possibly damaging their ears.</p>

<p>IMO it's disgusting that the study claims it's due to music that kids became
smarter, and not because of the abstract mathematical and logical aspects of
generating music, which &mdash;itself&mdash; is not music.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410500342542">This other study</a> says that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">that study</a> is shit, but then
adds its own shit by doing similar wrong shit.  One funny aspect it mentions
that music is good to calm retards.  See&hellip; I LITERALLY told you music is for
retards!</p>
