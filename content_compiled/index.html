<h2 id="can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity"><a class="hindex" href="#can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity">1.</a> can consciousness arise from
physical complexity?</h2>

<p>This article contains a series of thought experiments that try to mimic
evolution from a physics and evolutionary point of view, with the goal to see
how will consciousness arise from complexity.</p>

<h3 id="can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1"><a class="hindex" href="#can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1">1.1.</a> thought experiment</h3>

<p>First let's define consciousness:</p>

<p id="cite_consciousness"><strong><a href="#cite_consciousness">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em><span class="ignored">$x$</span> is said to have &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; if, and only if, <span class="ignored">$x$</span> has a
           point of view.</em></p>

<h4 id="can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1.1"><a class="hindex" href="#can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1.1">1.1.1.</a> low complexity</h4>

<p>Consider the following thought experiment:</p>

<ul>
<li> A large basket is filled with lots of balls of equal sizes, but different
  masses.</li>
<li> The basket is constantly shaking.</li>
<li> The rule is:  balls at the bottom are the losers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Result:</em> after a while, heavy balls will be eliminated 1st, and the lighter
survive longer.</p>

<p id="cite_simq"><strong><a href="#cite_simq">Question 1.</a></strong> <em>Do the winning balls have any consciousness?  Feelings?  A point of
         view?</em></p>

<p id="cite_sima"><strong><a href="#cite_sima">Answer 1.</a></strong> <em>As per the standard Physics model:  perhaps they don't.  They are just
       stuff happening as matters interact as energy moves from higher to lower
       &mdash; they have no point of view, nor feelings.</em></p>

<h4 id="can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1.2"><a class="hindex" href="#can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1.2">1.1.2.</a> more complexity</h4>

<p>Now let's increase the mechanical complexity of the balls:</p>

<ul>
<li> Each ball has a working combustion engine inside of it (with fuel tank,
  throttle, etc).</li>
<li> Each ball can swing a leg (or stick/bat) by its engine.</li>
<li> Engine's throttle is attached to a tentacle.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Result:</em>  balls that have strategically positioned throttle tentacles will
survive longer than otherwise.  Reason: the position of the throttle can
determine that if a 2nd ball comes close to get over the 1st ball, the 2nd ball
will hit the throttle tentacle of the 1st, which causes the 1st to spin a kick
against the 2nd, ultimately disabling it from getting on top.</p>

<p>Now, let's ask  <a href="#cite_simq">Question 1</a> again.  <a href="#cite_sima">Answer 1</a> still holds.</p>

<h4 id="can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1.3"><a class="hindex" href="#can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.1.3">1.1.3.</a> much more complexity</h4>

<p>The balls now have several sensors (cameras, pressure, gyroscopes,
accelerometers), with ASICs that implement image processing using neural
networks.  Each ball even has a rat's brain hooked up in it as an extra
processing unit beyond the ASICs.</p>

<p>What about now, how will the answer to  <a href="#cite_simq">Question 1</a> be?  Will the standard Physics
model find out that the balls have a point of view?  Nope,  <a href="#cite_sima">Answer 1</a> still holds,
and even the rat's brain is nothing but a mere collection of matter that's
reacting with each other as energy is flowing from higher levels to lower
levels.</p>

<h3 id="can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.2"><a class="hindex" href="#can_consciousness_arise_from_physical_complexity.2">1.2.</a> conclusion</h3>

<p id="cite_physics_cant_consciousness"><strong><a href="#cite_physics_cant_consciousness">Theorem 1.</a></strong> <em>Consciousness is beyond the reach of the standard Physics model.</em></p>

<p>But we seem to strongly know that we have a point of view, or consciousness.
Therefore, I think, consciousness is not physical, and that the reality might
be that we are living beings in another world, that are hooked up to some
simulation.  We might be right in a simulation (possibly tested for something).</p>

<p>IMO consciousness seems beyond this universe/simulation.  I.e. this
simulation's internal API does not expose enough information to tell us where
consciousness comes from.</p>

<p>Maybe we are in a pretty deep recursion of simulations.  Maybe if we die here,
we wake up in the parent simulation, up until a point where we end up being in
a life form that finally exposes adequate API to explain the source of
consciousness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I think it's good to behave nicely in this simulation, based on how
<em>nice</em> is defined in this simulation.  So that in case we are being audited for
good behaviour, we do a good job, and please the simulation's master.</p>

<p>You may ask:</p>

<p id="cite_isgooduniversal"><strong><a href="#cite_isgooduniversal">Question 2.</a></strong> <em>How do we know if we do a good thing in this simulation, then it's
         good in the parent simulation?</em></p>

<p>To which I answer:</p>

<p id="cite_perhapsgooduniversal"><strong><a href="#cite_perhapsgooduniversal">Answer 2.</a></strong> <em>We don't know.  But IMO that's our best bet.</em></p>

<p>My reasoning to  <a href="#cite_perhapsgooduniversal">Answer 2</a> is that, if we simulate people in this
universe to test people, it would not make sense to hate those that behave
properly in the scenario of our child simulation.  Evolution rewards good
doing, and it's hard to see a surviving species hating the good doers.</p>

<p>I know it's not enough evidence.  But until I formalize this better, which I
work on slowly from time to time, that's what I have for now.</p>

<h2 id="beard"><a class="hindex" href="#beard">2.</a> beard</h2>

<p>You don't grow <em>beard</em>, nor that you shave <em>him</em>.  It's rather that <em>beard</em>
lets you grow under <em>him</em> as shown in  <a href="#cite_beardpic">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_beardpic" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="A man sporting beard." src="/pics/beard.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_beardpic">Figure 1.</a></strong> A man honoured to grow under <em>beard</em>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>OTOH, when you become too decadent to deserve such honour, <em>beard</em> shaves you
away as shown in  <a href="#cite_trudeaupic">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="blindfolded_faggot_thought_experiment"><a class="hindex" href="#blindfolded_faggot_thought_experiment">3.</a> the blindfolded faggot thought
experiment</h2>

<p>This is a thought experiment to investigate what makes a faggot, a faggot.
Consider the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> <em>Group 1</em> &mdash; A blindfoldeded faggot is given a woman's butt, but the faggot
  is lied to that the butt is a man's.  He then f***s the butt, then rates
  it from 1 to 5 (1 is bad, 5 is good).
</li>
<li> <em>Group 2</em> &mdash; Same, but the faggot is told the truth that it's a female's
  butt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine that we randomly sample 100 faggots from Amsterdam's faggot pride
rally, and randomly assign 50 of them to <em>Group 1</em> and the other 50 to <em>Group
2</em> &mdash; what do you think will happen?</p>

<p>On average, <em>I bet</em> this will happen:</p>

<ul>
<li> Faggots of <em>Group 1</em> would say &ldquo;<em>OMG BEST MALE BUTT EVER 5/5!!</em>&rdquo;.</li>
<li> Faggots of <em>Group 2</em> would say &ldquo;<em>No.  0/5.  Can't even have an erection.  We
  are born faggots don't you know?</em>&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably agree.  Because, <em>I guess</em>, a male's anus is the same as a
female's.  Or, if you are too skeptic, you may at least agree that a female's
anus is like, say, a 10 years old boy's anus<sup><a href="#fn___7">1</a></sup>?  This probably also explains
why faggots are often crypto pedos.</p>

<p>Here is what I think the thought experiment implies:</p>

<ol>
<li> Technically, <em>in the thought experiment</em>, the faggot is fucking the anus, not
  the butt, not the legs, not the face with shaved beard, etc.</li>
<li> The reason a faggot appreciates an anus that's attached to a man's butt, over
  another that's attached to a female's butt, is because of the <em>context</em>
  around the anus.  E.g. man's anus has the context that it is attached to a
  hairy man's ass that's attached to a face with shaved beard.</li>
<li> Such context information is a very high-level information.</li>
<li> High-level context-information is IMO processed by the brain.</li>
<li> IMO neural activity about context information is by far mostly influenced by
  the past memory, or environment, than (say) genes.</li>
<li> Therefore, the primary contributor in the making of a faggot is the
  environment, and not the genes (genes might be only a marginal/secondary
  cause).</li>
</ol>
<p id="cite_faggotenv"><strong><a href="#cite_faggotenv">Theorem 2.</a></strong> <em>Environment is the main factor in the making of a faggot.</em></p>

<footer>
<hr/>
<ul style="list-style:none;padding:0; margin:0;"><li id="fn___7"><small>1. I'm just guessing.  I never tried
any.  IMO it's easy to simulate anuses given their simplicity since they are
merely some elastic holes.  IMO You don't need to actually put your junk in
anuses to discover that they are elastic holes.</small></li>

<h2 id="imo_music_not_good"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good">4.</a> imo music is not good</h2>

<p>Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:</p>

<ul>
<li> That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.  Now the next question is:</p>

<p id="cite_whyneedmusic"><strong><a href="#cite_whyneedmusic">Question 3.</a></strong> <em>Why do you need that information?</em></p>

<p>and its answer:</p>

<p id="cite_studyingretards"><strong><a href="#cite_studyingretards">Answer 3.</a></strong> <em>Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.</em></p>

<p>So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!</p>

<p>Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:</p>

<ul>
<li> Weakens your ear drums.</li>
<li> Induces bias to your brain's activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <em>drums</em> damage point, evolution-wise, we are more evolved to handle
sounds found in nature, as opposed to sounds produced by musical instruments.
This may explain why music is more harmful to our ears than natural sounds.</p>

<p>But what do I mean by the <em>bias</em> shit?  Basically music IMO alters how you
think.  E.g. depending on the music you listen, you may end up being more
risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not good, because it induces some
artificial bias in your brain's function as shown in  <a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 3</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_biasvariance" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Some shooting targets showing the bias-variance trade-off." src="https://cave.mn/pics/bias-variance-tradeoff.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_biasvariance">Figure 3.</a></strong> Bias-variance trade-off.</figcaption></figure>

<p>IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.</p>

<h3 id="imo_music_not_good.1"><a class="hindex" href="#imo_music_not_good.1">4.1.</a> criticism</h3>

<p>Some people disagree with me and say that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">music can make people
smarter</a>.  But IMO  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> has a fundamental flaw: the alternative
to music classes for kids were <em>drama lessons</em> and <em>nothing</em>.  They didn't
include, say, <em>mathematics</em> classes as an alternative.</p>

<p>This is why  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">the study</a> is shit: maybe the reason the kids that learned
music became smarter was thanks to them needing to learn musical notes (those
fancy symbols for music) which functions as some kind of programming (except
for generating sound).</p>

<p>In other words, if the kids had taken a <em>programming</em> class, or extra
<em>mathematics</em> classes, then maybe they would have been even smarter, without
having the side effect of musical instruments possibly damaging their ears.</p>

<p>IMO it's disgusting that the study claims it's due to music that kids became
smarter, and not because of the abstract mathematical and logical aspects of
generating music, which &mdash;itself&mdash; is not music.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410500342542">This other study</a> says that  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x">that study</a> is shit, but then
adds its own shit by doing similar wrong shit.  One funny aspect it mentions
that music is good to calm retards.  See&hellip; I LITERALLY told you music is for
retards!</p>
