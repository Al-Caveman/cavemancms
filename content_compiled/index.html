<h2 id="insulty_app_names"><a class="hindex" href="#insulty_app_names">1.</a> insulty app names</h2>

<p><em>Synopsys&mdash;</em>Some SJWs forked a FOSS software, only to rename it, because they
thought former name was offensive to them.  But when I did the same, by forking
yet another software that I thought its name was offensive, they called my work
<em>&ldquo;a joke&rdquo;</em>.  Then, they freaked, and deleted all traces of this conversation
(which happened on their Github issues page).  But, very fortunately, this
conversation  <a href="http://paste.debian.net/plain/1098169">got archived</a> by some very brave Internet heroes,
so that this event will be in history for generations to come!</p>

<h3 id="insulty_app_names.1"><a class="hindex" href="#insulty_app_names.1">1.1.</a> background</h3>

<p>As you might have  <a href="https://itsfoss.com/gimp-fork-glimpse/">heard</a>, some  <a href="https://github.com/Member1221">trannies</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/Member1221">faggots</a>
forked  <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> because they thought <em>GIMP</em> was an offensive name to them,
and called it  <a href="https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse">Glimpse</a>, instead.  So that, hopefully, they can
finally use GIMP at school, without getting bullied by students and teachers.</p>

<p>So, I thought, why not?  I &mdash;too&mdash; know a software that its name sounds like
an insult.  Henceforth, I forked  <a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser">Qutebrowser</a> into
 <a href="https://github.com/Al-Caveman/glimpsebrowser">Glimpsebrowser</a>, because IMO the Q-word sounds like an insult
to me.</p>

<h3 id="insulty_app_names.2"><a class="hindex" href="#insulty_app_names.2">1.2.</a> glimpse software foundation</h3>

<p>But why stop there?  Why not extend this Glimpsetardian movement into the
<em>Glimpse Software Foundation</em>, where SJWs unite in power to rename all software
with bad names?  We got a few:</p>

<ul>
<li> GIMP into Glimpse editor <em>&mdash;accomplished</em>.</li>
<li> Git into Glimpse version control system.</li>
<li> Qutebrowser into Glimpse image editor <em>&mdash;accomplished</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I filed an Issue in the Glimpse editor Github page, and this happened:</p>

<ol>
<li> I proposed the Glimpse Software Foundation.</li>
<li> A  <a href="https://github.com/Member1221">faggot</a> closed the issue, and said that what I am doing is a joke.</li>
<li> I asked, why?  I did <em>exactly</em> what you did.  Yet you say it is a joke?</li>
<li> A Glimpsetard locked the issue, then after a while, also <em>deleted</em> it
  entirely (I guess because it revealed that <em>even they</em> know that what they
  are doing is <em>a joke</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, an legendary Internet hero got all this archived, and can be found
 <a href="http://paste.debian.net/plain/1098169">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="insulty_app_names.3"><a class="hindex" href="#insulty_app_names.3">1.3.</a> deeper analysis</h3>

<p>I'm confused.  I thought that trannies and faggots are cool with immoralities,
as they reportedly dick/tit flash in streets in front of kids during their gay
pride marches.  But <em>somehow</em> they just can't stand a bad software name.  Wat?</p>

<p>I invented new food, that IMO deprecates Gordon Ramsay.  See  <a href="#cite_gordon">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<figure id="cite_gordon" style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Gordon Ramsay" src="/pics/gordon_ramsay.png" /><figcaption><strong><a href="#cite_gordon">Figure 1.</a></strong> Gordon Ramsay</figcaption></figure>

<p>My new invented food:</p>

<ol>
<li> Bring a thin bread.</li>
<li> Spread 1 spoon salted butter on it.</li>
<li> Put several layers of smoked turkey<sup><a href="#fn___10">1</a></sup>, or smoked beef, on it.</li>
<li> Put hand-full of  <em>uncut</em> mushroom there.</li>
<li> Put hand-full of some veggies.</li>
<li> Mildly wrap similar to tacos.</li>
<li> Eat.</li>
</ol>
<p id="cite_noheatingcutting"><strong><a href="#cite_noheatingcutting">Note 2.</a></strong> <em>Do not heat bread/smoked turkey/meat, nor cut mushrooms.  Heck, maybe
     don't even wash your veggies.</em></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ol>
<li> <em>Close proximity&mdash;</em>All stuff taken from fridge.</li>
<li> <em>Convenient storage&mdash;</em>Ingredients can be kept in fridge for some time.</li>
<li> <em>Simple process&mdash;</em>No complex processing.  E.g. no heating, cutting, etc.</li>
<li> <em>High-protein low-carb potential&mdash;</em>Add more beef/chicken to increase protein content.</li>
<li> <em>Great taste&mdash;</em>Yes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>

<ol>
<li> Probably not a general-purpose <em>perfect food</em> yet.  But plz stay tuned for

<h2 id="perfect_food"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food">3.</a> perfect food</h2>

<p><em>Synopsis&mdash;</em>Basically, a food is <em>perfect</em>, if and only if, it is the cheapest
thing that offers you the nutritions that you require.  Else, you are wasting
your money.</p>

<p>As a result, pizza, for example, is clearly not perfect, but rather a waste,
because <em>think</em>:  do you really think the process of making a pizza slice is
the cheapest way to get 285 calories, 12g protein, 10g fat, and 36g carbs?</p>

<p>Think of the operation cost of pizza making, which requires running an oven and
baking.  Imagine the energy bill, and time needed.  Clearly pizza is a wasteful
way of creating nutritional values, as there are many ways we can optimize the
process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could get what a pizza slice would give you, by simply
frying some egg, with cheese, and potatoes, for example, at a cheaper price
point.  I'm not saying that this is perfect either, but it suffices to show you
that pizza is <em>clearly</em> a waste as it is very easy to think of the same
(nutritional value-wise) at a cheaper price point.</p>

<p>But people buy pizza coz they think it's <em>sounds crunchy</em> when you eat it.
Fuck that nonsense.  There is no nutrition in <em>crunch</em>.  This makes pizza a
form of drug that creates artificial need (by the allure of its crunch and
smell) to cause people to make the irrational decision of buying it.
<em>#BanFuckingPizza</em>.</p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.1"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.1">3.1.</a> i'm smart</h3>

<p>Say that <span class="ignored">$\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n\}$</span> is the set of all foods.
For example, <span class="ignored">$f_1$</span> could be fried chicken breast, <span class="ignored">$f_2$</span> could be orange, etc.</p>

<p>Also say that for any food <span class="ignored">$f_i \in \mathcal{F}$</span>, <span class="ignored">$c_i$</span> is the cost of <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span>
(i.e. money and time needed to be spent in order to get <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span> into ur belly),
and <span class="ignored">$n_i$</span> is the nutritional values that your body obtains after eating <span class="ignored">$f_i$</span>.</p>

<p>Then, if your body needs nutritional values in interval <span class="ignored">$[n_a, n_b]$</span> (for
whatever health goal you have), then:</p>

<p id="cite_perfectfood"><strong><a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 1.</a></strong> <em>Food <span class="ignored">$f_i \in \mathcal{F}$</span> is said to be perfect, if and only if:
            <span class="ignored">$$                n_a \le n_i \le n_b
            $$</span>
           and, for all <span class="ignored">$f_j \in \{f_l \in \mathcal{F} : n_a \le n_l \le n_b\}$</span>:
            <span class="ignored">$$            c_i \le c_j
            $$</span></em></p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.2"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.2">3.2.</a> wat if food fails to meet  <a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 1</a>?</h3>

<p>Well, then it's a waste of money.  Period.  Could be a little waste to you,
depending on how spoiled you are, but it remains a waste nonetheless, and you
will be at a loss.</p>

<p>Today's food is mostly heavily a waste of money as they fail to meet
 <a href="#cite_perfectfood">Definition 1</a>.  Sadly, the concept of <em>food</em> &mdash;today&mdash; is looked from the
view of taste and joy, very similar to how drugs are looked at.</p>

<p>Therefore, it's fair to say that today's food industry has morphed into a fork
of the drug industry, where unnecessary additives are added to lure people in
in order to take maximum money.  It is no longer <em>only</em> nutritional.  It is now
<em>partly</em> nutritional, and <em>partly</em> wasteful to fool idiots to get a slice of
their money (almost everyone on this planet).</p>

<h3 id="perfect_food.3"><a class="hindex" href="#perfect_food.3">3.3.</a> now wat?</h3>

<p>We need to find a principled methodology to objectively guide us on the process
of creating perfect food.   I will keep you updated when I nail this.  Plz stay
tuned.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts_on_prisons"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons">4.</a> thoughts on prisons</h2>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_prisons.1"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons.1">4.1.</a> what is a <em>prison</em>?</h3>

<p id="cite_p1"><strong><a href="#cite_p1">Definition 2.</a></strong> <em>A place to store suspects until the court figures out what to do to
           them (aka &ldquo;jail&rdquo;).</em></p>

<p id="cite_p2"><strong><a href="#cite_p2">Definition 3.</a></strong> <em>A place to store bad peeps until they become good peeps.</em></p>

<p id="cite_p3"><strong><a href="#cite_p3">Definition 4.</a></strong> <em>A place to store bad peeps as a form punishment.  The degree of the
           punishment is determined by the length of time spent in storage.</em></p>

<p id="cite_p4"><strong><a href="#cite_p4">Definition 5.</a></strong> <em>A  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">Gulag</a>.</em></p>

<p id="cite_p5"><strong><a href="#cite_p5">Definition 6.</a></strong> <em>Any combination of  <a href="#cite_p1">Definition 2</a>,  <a href="#cite_p2">Definition 3</a>,  <a href="#cite_p3">Definition 4</a>, or  <a href="#cite_p4">Definition 5</a>.  This gives us the
           following number of extra variations:
           <span class="ignored">$$           \sum_{i=2}^{4} {4 \choose i} = 6+4+1 = 11
           $$</span></em></p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_prisons.2"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons.2">4.2.</a> thoughts on  <a href="#cite_p1">Definition 2</a></h3>

<p>If the storage is causing no harm on the suspect, then the suspect could be
stored indefinitely.  This implies things like, a very comfortable storage with
nice bed, food, no harm on income, no harm on psychology, no mixing with bad
people that may corrupt him, etc.</p>

<p>But usually the storage does cause some harm (e.g. shit bed, mixing with shit
people, etc).  Thus,  <a href="#cite_p1">Definition 2</a> is only good if the expected harm with the free
suspect is more than the expected harm with the stored suspect, which depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li> How slow the court is to finally figure out shit.</li>
<li> How likely the suspect is to run away if he is not stored.</li>
<li> How much loss would happen if the suspect runs away (e.g. how much money gets
  permanently lost).</li>
<li> How much suffering will the suspect endure by being stored; depends on how
  shit the place is.</li>
<li> &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, I think there is a lot of room in reality of making  <a href="#cite_p1">Definition 2</a> a good tool
in a legal system if the storage is not for too long, and the storage is not
too harmful on the suspect.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_prisons.3"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons.3">4.3.</a> thoughts on  <a href="#cite_p2">Definition 3</a></h3>

<p> <a href="#cite_p2">Definition 3</a> is basically a synonym to the naturally occurring concept known as
<em>&ldquo;parent&rdquo;</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>If the bad person is a child</em> &mdash; then he should be parented by his biological
  parents, or relatives.  Evolution has already made parents, and family
  members, evolve to be good trainers of their children, but a government is
  not evolved as much as them.  Therefore, resorting to use a government
  facility as a parenting facility is suboptimal, and we better use what
  billions of years of evolution has given us:  biological parents or
  relatives.<p>Involving the government to offer parenting services goes under
  micromanagement, ends up wasting too much money, opens the door for a corrupt
  government to raise such bad people as good voters for them, and lack enough
  personal touch in fixing the bad people.</p>

</li>
<li> <em>If the bad person is an adult</em> &mdash; then it means that the time of parenting
  is gone.  In such case, you better give up on parenting, and look for other
  things.<p>Practically, when governments store bad people in prisons, with the claim of
  making them better people, they often make them into worse people, as they
  mix up with possibly worse people in the prison.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>So those who claim that <em>prisons</em> are as per  <a href="#cite_p2">Definition 3</a>, they are indirectly saying
that prisons are bad.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_prisons.4"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons.4">4.4.</a> thoughts on  <a href="#cite_p3">Definition 4</a></h3>

<p>Let's look at the extreme ends of punishment by storage:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>The most peaceful form of storage</em> &mdash;  a comfortable hotel.  In such case, it's
  a pure waste of money.</li>
<li> <em>The most painful form of storage</em> &mdash; either (depending on country):
<ul>
<li> A solitary confinement:  so much money is spent on feeding the bad doer,
      electricity, building maintenance, and guard salaries.</li>
<li> An imprisonment with a bunch of horrible gangs:  so much money is wasted,
      plus the imprisoned people turned into worse people (possibly also with
      herpes).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the bright side,  <a href="#cite_p3">Definition 4</a> can have a deterring effect via <em>fear</em>, as it may
cause the good people feel that becoming bad people is a bad idea.</p>

<p>But, there are cheaper ways of achieving <em>fear</em> and deterrence of good people
from becoming bad, that does not have the side effects of  <a href="#cite_p3">Definition 4</a>, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li> Monetary fines.</li>
<li> Firing from job.</li>
<li> Lashing/flocking.</li>
<li> Execution.</li>
<li> &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Such methods hardly cost any money (i.e. no money to spend on food, building
maintenance, guards salaries, etc), and hardly has any effect of mixing bad
people with worse people (and hence less chance of corrupting people beyond
their corruption).</p>

<p>So,  <a href="#cite_p3">Definition 4</a> is surely a bad idea, as there are equally effective methods that are
cheaper with less side effects.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_prisons.5"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons.5">4.5.</a> thoughts on  <a href="#cite_p4">Definition 5</a></h3>

<p>A  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">Gulag</a> is basically a forced labour camp, with huge negative emotional
thoughts around it due to Stalin.  But &mdash;philosophically&mdash;  what is a forced
labour camp?  Is <em>&ldquo;capitalism&rdquo;</em> a huge forced labour camp?  Is <em>life</em> a forced
labour camp?</p>

<p>See, it's fundamentally a more complex problem.  Just because Stalin abused the
concept, and showed us that it can be bad, it does not mean that the concept
itself is fundamentally bad.  We just need to have a deeper look right now.</p>

<p>What if someone shits on streets, or on someone's property?  IMO it's fair to
have the law enforcement force him clean the streets and the properties.  Is it
forced labour?  Yes.  Is it a form of Gulag?  Yes.  Is it bad?  No.  It seems a
great disciplinary action to fairly punish the bad doer in kind.</p>

<p>For the vast majority of cases, we don't need forced labour camps, as
capitalism and the monetary system functions as a huge Gulag (which is good).
Hence, often paying monetary fees to compensate for damage caused by bad doers
is a good idea, and is practically a good form Gulag.</p>

<p>My thoughts are:</p>

<ul>
<li> Stalin-style Gulag is very bad.</li>
<li> Making people who shit in streets, to clean the streets, is a good kind of
  Gulag.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thoughts_on_prisons.6"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons.6">4.6.</a> thoughts on  <a href="#cite_p5">Definition 6</a></h3>

<p>Since  <a href="#cite_p5">Definition 6</a> is a mixture of  <a href="#cite_p1">Definition 2</a>,  <a href="#cite_p2">Definition 3</a>,  <a href="#cite_p3">Definition 4</a> and  <a href="#cite_p4">Definition 5</a>, my thoughts on it is also
a mixture of what's in  <a href="#thoughts_on_prisons.2">Section 4.2</a>,  <a href="#thoughts_on_prisons.3">Section 4.3</a>,
 <a href="#thoughts_on_prisons.4">Section 4.4</a> and  <a href="#thoughts_on_prisons.5">Section 4.5</a>.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts_on_prisons.7"><a class="hindex" href="#thoughts_on_prisons.7">4.7.</a> summary</h3>

<p>These are good:</p>

<ul>
<li> Storing high-risk suspects, comfortably in isolation, until the court figures
  out the verdict.</li>
<li> Making people, who shit in streets, clean the streets.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are bad:</p>

<ul>
<li> Punishing people by storing them, as it is too expensive.</li>
<li> Parenting people by storing them, as it's micromanagement and a redundant
  concept to <em>biological parents or relatives</em>, except that governments are not
  evolved to be good at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The better alternatives to the bad ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li> Forgiveness as a choice to victims in case they just feel so.  Sometimes
  forgiveness does better to a society, and giving this tool to victims allows
  them to act dynamically according to the current situation that they live in.
</li>
<li> Instead of punishment-by-storage, cheaper punishments should be used, such as
  monetary fines, termination from job, flocking, lashing, exile, capital
  punishment, etc.<p>IMO capital punishment is even more humane than life-time sentence as the
  latter amounts as 20 years of torture (i.e. beating/raping by gang members
  in prisons).</p>

</li>
</ul>
