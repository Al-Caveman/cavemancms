<h2>and also CaveMark!</h2>
<p>MarkDown, and its variants, are simple languages to let authors format their
texts.  You may find them used in places like StackExchange, YouTube, etc.
This column defines a new MarkDown variant, that I wish to hear your opinion
about.</p>

<p>The general theme of this variant is that it attempts to allow the author
<em>only</em> focus on the content, and ignore the style.  For example,
sometimes we wish to emphasize some strings or words, so we should use the
&lt;em&gt; HTML tag, which will display the emphasized text in a style that
depends on your CSS file.</p>

<p>So why do I not like MarkDown, and its variants? In my view, they give too much
styling power to the author, as they let them decide whether text is italic,
bold, underlined, and where should an image or a quote appear.</p>

<p>Here are the bits in CaveMark that, in my view, are new:
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Automatic citing:</em> if \(x\) is the ID of a resource that has
        type 'image', then the author can refer to it by writing [\(x\)] in
        text.  The CaveMark parser will then will automatically place 'fig. 1'
        in text (assuming it's the 1st cited figure), show the actual figure
        after the current paragraph alongside its caption, and 'fig. 1' there
        will be also a link to the position where the image is place.
        Subsequent use of [\(x\)] will be just links that, if clicked, would
        move the page to where the image is.  If type is 'definition' (instead
        of 'image'), then 'def. 1' will be shown in text, and a text block with
        the definition appears later.  If type is a link (default), then [1] is
        shown in text, that points to a references section underneath, similar
        to \(\LaTeX\).  I don't know of any existing MarkDown variant tht does
        this.
    </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Here are the not-so-new bits that, perhaps, largely overlap with MarkDown:
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Resources:</em> after five hyphens, -----, or more, comes the
        resources section.  Each resource's syntax is [ID,TYPE] TEXT. ID is a
        handle to cite it later on, TYPE could also be:
        'url', 'image', 'quote', definition, theorem, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Paragraphs:</em> texts separated by double, or more, new lines.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Headings:</em> lines starting with #, ##, ..., will define headings
        and their levels. Heading and trailing whitespace will be ignored.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Emphasized text:</em> stuff surrounded by _.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Lists:</em> lines starting with "*" or "1." (must be 1) will be
        un-ordered, and ordered lists, respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Code:</em> <code>`this`</code> is a code, <code>```this is a code
        block```</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Escaping:</em> \ (backwards slash) is used to print
        them literally.  e.g. \_ will literally show an underscore instead of
        emphasizing.
    </li>
</ul></p>

<p>CaveMark shall be free and open source.  I'll probably license it under the
Ggpl3.0.</p>

<h2>CavemanCMS soon!</h2>
<p>cms = content management system.  e.g. thing that manages content in ur blog,
or site.  but they all suck.  so i am making the best cms ever.  its called
<em>CavemanCMS</em>.</p>

<p>usually, existing cms that r dynamic, e.g. those that allow u to post, and ur
users to reply in somewhat real time, require u to run a dynamic web server.
e.g. maybe fastcgi with php/python, etc.  of course, right?</p>

<p>but here is the magic:  with CavemanCMS, u shall have a fully dynamic cms, yet
ur website remains fully static.  you shall upload all u want, yet ur web
server will not even need to support anything other than GET requests.</p>

<p>and it shall also be blazing fast.  stay tuned.  this shit is awesome.  God
willing will make some noise.  trust.</p>

<h2>how muscle works</h2>
<p><em>muscle stimulation period</em> - some site (forgot) suggested that the
growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.
but not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
strength, hypertrophy, etc?  gotta search this..</p>

<p><em>strength vs. hypertrophy</em> - someone (on utube) suggested that strength
training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance by
storing more water in the muscle.</p>

<p><em>number of sets</em> - someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training
is better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference
of chest and thigh).</p>

<p><em>resting period between sets</em> - <a
href='https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Fulltext/2008/06000/A_Brief_Review__How_Much_Rest_between_Sets_.9.aspx'>this,</a>
suggests that optimum resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength
training, 30-90secs for hypertrophy or endurance.</p>

<h2>me not like decoration; here why</h2>
<p>1st, let's define what is a <em>smart</em> dude:
<p class='special def'>
    a dude \(x\) is said to be smart if, and only if, \(x\) does stuff that
    maximize his survivability, and avoids stuff that limit him from maximizing
    his survivability.  this implies that he eats healthy food, learns juicy
    mathy sciency stuff, avoids wasting his time, etc.
</p></p>

<p>and what is a <em>decotative</em> item:
<p class='special def'>
    for a given world \(w\), a thing \(t_w\) in world \(w\) is said to be
    decorative if, and only if, \(t_w\) does not help its owner maximize his
    survivability in world \(w\).  i.e. has no real use.  e.g. bunch of pretty
    pics hanging on the wall of ur toilet.
</p></p>

<p>think a bit.  if u agree with those definitions, then the following theorem is
true by definition:</p>

<p><p class='special theorem'>
    in a world with only smart ppl, where ppl can maximize their survivability
    (i.e. still some work to do), then they will not allocate any resource,
    e.g. money/time, to make/buy decorative stuff.  i.e. no fancy pics hanging
    on walls, statues, fancy stitching on clothing, etc.  but all resources
    will be used to maximize their survivability.
</p></p>

<p>based on that theorem, it's easy to see why the following theorem is also true:</p>

<p><p class='special theorem'>
    a world with ppl investing some resource in making/buying decorative items,
    is necessarily a world that has at least 1 non-smart person.
</p></p>

<p>now let's be more specific on how the world with some non-smarties, as in the
2nd theorem, would look like:</p>

<p><ul>
    <li>
        possibility 1: non-smarties r doing a mistake for making/buying
        useless stuff that don't help maximize their survivability.
    </li>
    <li>
        possibility 2: smarties make/buy decorative items bcoz it
        happens that some non-smarties get manipulated this way more
        effectively for the selfish gains of the smarties.
    </li>
    <li>
        possibility 3: a mixture of the other possibilities above.
    </li>
    <li>
        possibility 4: what else?  i can't find any..  this list seems
        ccomplete, imo.
    </li>
</ul></p>

<p>as u can see, they r all sad cases.  i.e. either exploiting smarties, or
misguided non-smarties.  this is why i dislike decorative items: because they
seem to only reflect sad underlying realities (possibilities above r sad cases
imo, and decorative items remind me of them).</p>
