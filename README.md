# Overview

**NOTE:** _WORK IN PROGRESS_. THIS IS STILL INCOMPLETE.  MAJOR FEATURES
MISSING.  READ [THIS](https://cave.mn/page/1/#sec_1) ARTICLE TO SEE WHERE THIS
PROJECT IS HEADING.

For a silly demo for the latest version in action, checkout the [caveman's
theories](https://cave.mn) website.  But, note again, the glory that CavemanCMS
will bring, once it completes, is way beyond how it *looks*.

You may like the appearance of [caveman's theories](https://cave.mn) website,
and its nice *looks* may fool you to think that it might be the main selling
point.  But, nope it isn't!  I am dumb, but not that dumb.  If I wanted the
*looks* only, I could have written a mere new template/theme for an existing
CMS.

What is ahead is orders of magnitude better in terms of *functionality and
features*, a totally revolutionary better than anything heard of so far.  I
don't have the time to tell you exactly about the features, you  may read
[that](https://cave.mn/page/1/#sec_1) for this.
