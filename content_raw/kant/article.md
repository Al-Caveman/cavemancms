#kants_shit_is_obsolete [kant]'s [categoricalimp] is obsolete

I just wanna say that [kant]'s [categoricalimp]:

[!thecategoricalimp]

is obsoleted by my superior alternative:

[!dogood]

_Why?_ you may ask.  Bcoz _simpler_ and _correcter_.  The _simpler_ is maybe
easy to see, but why _correcter_?

[dogood] is correcter than [thecategoricalimp] because former is much more
objective than the latter.  E.g. with [thecategoricalimp] a suicidal person may
say "_Welp... I'm OK to be killed, therefore it is also OK for me to kill
others_''.  This problem does not exist in [dogood].
