#kants_shit_is_obsolete [kant]'s [categoricalimp] is obsolete

I just wanna say that [kant]'s [categoricalimp]:

[!thecategoricalimp]

is obsoleted by my superior alternative:

[!dogood]

_Why?_ you may ask.  Bcoz _simpler_ and _correcter_.  The _simpler_ is maybe
easy to see, but why _correcter_?

## suicide case

[dogood] is correcter than [thecategoricalimp] because former is much more
objective than the latter.  E.g. with [thecategoricalimp] a suicidal person may
say "_Welp... I'm OK to be killed, therefore it is also OK for me to kill
others_''.  This problem does not exist in [dogood].

But [kant] knew of that suicide issue and proposed a solution[:Thanks to
_saachan_ for telling me.].  So [categoricalimpsuicide:he added a special case]
to handle the suicide.  IMO he is basically adding the exception "_let's also
not get extinct!_''[:I'm paraphrasing [kant]'s words in my own's.] --- my
[dogood] handles this issue cleanly without needing to add any special case!

## fancy facility case

Here is another example beyond the suicide case earlier where my [dogood]
trumps [kant]'s [thecategoricalimp]:

* I want to build a massive research facility that will help humanity do some
  really advanced research to save humanity.
* But this facility is soooOoOo big that there can be only one of its kind on
  Earth.  If any one else tried to build another facility of this kind, it will
  harm the functionality of the other.  It's some kind of advanced research.
* This means I will want to build this good facility, yet at the same time not
  want anyone else to build a similar facility.

Under [kant]'s [thecategoricalimp], it will be _immoral_ of me if I created
that obviously good research facility!  IMO this shows a limitation in
[thecategoricalimp].

While my [dogood] does not suffer from any of those exceptions.
As you see, my shit is simpler and better than [kant]'s shit.

## why didn't [kant] see [dogood]?

Maybe in part because he was from the 1700s, while evolution came later IMO
since [darwin] is an 1800s dude.  This matters because it relates to how I
define [watisgood:good].
