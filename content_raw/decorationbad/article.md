definition:smartdude
text: A dude $x$ is said to be smart if, and only if, $x$ does stuff that
      maximize his survivability, and avoids stuff that limit him from
      maximizing his survivability.  This implies that he eats healthy food,
      learns juicy mathy sciency stuff, avoids wasting his time, etc.

definition:decorative
text: For a given world $w$, a thing $t_w$ in world $w$ is said to be
      decorative if, and only if, $t_w$ does not help its owner maximize his
      survivability in world $w$.  I.e. has no real use.  E.g. bunch of
      pretty pics hanging on the wall of your toilet.

theorem:smartworld
text: In a world with only smart dudes, then they will not allocate
      any resource, e.g. money/time, to make/buy decorative stuff.  i.e. no
      fancy pics hanging on walls, statues, fancy stitching on clothing, etc.
      but all resources will be used to maximize their survivability.

theorem:dumbworld
text: A world with dudes investing some resource in making/buying
      decorative items, is necessarily a world that has at least 1 non-smart
      person.

# me not like decoration; here why

1st, let's define a couple of things.  [smartdude] defines what is a _smart_
dude, and [decorative] defines what is a decorative item.

Think a bit.  If you agree with [smartdude] and [decorative], then [smartworld]
is true by definition.


Based on [smartworld], it's easy to see why [dumbworld] is also true.

Now let's be more specific on how the world with some non-smarties, as in the
[dumbworld], would look like:

* _Possibility 1:_ Non-smarties are doing a mistake for making/buying
  useless stuff that don't help maximize their survivability.

* _Possibility 2:_ Smarties make/buy decorative items because it
  happens that some non-smarties get manipulated this way more effectively for
  the selfish gains of the smarties.

* _Possibility 3:_ A mixture of the other possibilities above.
* _Possibility 4:_ What else?  I can't find any..  This list seems
  complete, IMO.

As you can see, they are all sad cases.  I.e. either exploiting smarties, or
misguided non-smarties.  This is why I dislike decorative items: because they
seem to only reflect sad underlying realities (possibilities above are sad
cases IMO, and decorative items remind me of them).
