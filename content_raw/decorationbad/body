1st, let's define what is a <em>smart</em> dude:
<p class='special def'>
    a dude \(x\) is said to be smart if, and only if, \(x\) does stuff that
    maximize his survivability, and avoids stuff that limit him from maximizing
    his survivability.  this implies that he eats healthy food, learns juicy
    mathy sciency stuff, avoids wasting his time, etc.
</p>

and what is a <em>decotative</em> item:
<p class='special def'>
    for a given world \(w\), a thing \(t_w\) in world \(w\) is said to be
    decorative if, and only if, \(t_w\) does not help its owner maximize his
    survivability in world \(w\).  i.e. has no real use.  e.g. bunch of pretty
    pics hanging on the wall of ur toilet.
</p>

think a bit.  if u agree with those definitions, then the following theorem is
true by definition:

<p class='special theorem'>
    in a world with only smart ppl, where ppl can maximize their survivability
    (i.e. still some work to do), then they will not allocate any resource,
    e.g. money/time, to make/buy decorative stuff.  i.e. no fancy pics hanging
    on walls, statues, fancy stitching on clothing, etc.  but all resources
    will be used to maximize their survivability.
</p>

based on that theorem, it's easy to see why the following theorem is also true:

<p class='special theorem'>
    a world with ppl investing some resource in making/buying decorative items,
    is necessarily a world that has at least 1 non-smart person.
</p>

now let's be more specific on how the world with some non-smarties, as in the
2nd theorem, would look like:

<ul>
    <li>
        possibility 1: non-smarties r doing a mistake for making/buying
        useless stuff that don't help maximize their survivability.
    </li>
    <li>
        possibility 2: smarties make/buy decorative items bcoz it
        happens that some non-smarties get manipulated this way more
        effectively for the selfish gains of the smarties.
    </li>
    <li>
        possibility 3: a mixture of the other possibilities above.
    </li>
    <li>
        possibility 4: what else?  i can't find any..  this list seems
        ccomplete, imo.
    </li>
</ul>

as u can see, they r all sad cases.  i.e. either exploiting smarties, or
misguided non-smarties.  this is why i dislike decorative items: because they
seem to only reflect sad underlying realities (possibilities above r sad cases
imo, and decorative items remind me of them).
