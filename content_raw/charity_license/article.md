##terms terms

* _Charitable resource_ --- any useful resource such as money, gold, land, car,
  etc.
* _Recipient_ --- a person that is getting the charity that is obtaining a
  _charitable good_.
* _Life form_ --- anything that we generally consider living, such as animals,
  plants, insects, bacteria, etc.
* _Wasted resource_ --- any resource that is spent to obtain a good that does
  not help maximize the survival of life forms in general.

##rules rules

rule:nowaste
text: _Recipient_ must not _waste_ any resources.  I.e. _recipient_ will only
      spend it in things that help maximize his survival.

rule:punishment
text: A _recipient_ that violates [nowaste] will be punished according to the
      expected harm that he has caused against the survival of life forms, and
      charged the cost to rectify such harm.

## examples of wasteful things

* Buying a first-hand car, when a second-hand car, or public transportation,
  could do the job.
* Buying needlessly complex clothing, or expensive clothing, simply because it
  looks good, beyond achieving a practical utility that helps in maximizing
  one's survival.  E.g. why would you buy a crocodile leather jacket when a
  cheaper material would offer you same, or better, warmth or protection
  against rain?
* Storing money for too long, without using it for a survival maximizing thing.
  This is bad as it effectively bars people from utilizing the money for a good
  cause.  Remember, such frozen money is fundamentally frozen past energy that
  is made unusable by society to advance.
* Buying food that is not the cheapest source of required nutrition.  E.g. cup
  cakes, pizza, ice cream --- all these foods are wasteful, because part of
  their price tag is because of making the bread fluffy, or making the cream
  cold, which is not helpful in a nutritional manner, hence necessarily
  wasteful.
* Alcohol --- these are too expensive for their nutritions, while at the same
  time increase the risk of addiction and alcoholism, which harms society a
  lot.

## examples of survival maximizing things

* Using public transportation, or a cheap second hand car, to get from point
  $A$ to point $B$ in a journey to do a survival maximizing thing.
* Eating healthy nutritious food, drinks.  
* Getting good education.
* Starting new investments that offer non-wasteful services, such as cheap
  healthy food, or funding research laboratories  or projects to further
  advance science.

## examples of punishments and harm rectification

* If a _recipient_ decides to waste his money by, say, selling alcohol to
  people, then the expected harm can be calculated statistically based on the
  expected number of alcoholics that he would probably end up creating, which
  is estimated by using statistics from previous years.  The _recipient_ will
  also be asked to undo his wrong by promote an anti-alcohol culture to
  potentially save as many people from alcoholism as the expected number of
  alcoholics that he has created.
* If a person is known to have died because of _recipient_'s wasteful acts,
  then the _recipient_ will be charged fees associated with losses of his
  murder based on statistics measured at the time.  E.g. each person costs over
  a million USD.
