# How Muscle Works

Below is a summary of what I have found so far:

* _Muscle stimulation period:_ some site (forgot) suggested that the
growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.
But not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
strength, hypertrophy, etc?  Gotta search this..  Someone in YouTube said 48
hours (WTF?).

* _Strength vs. Hypertrophy:_ someone (on utube) suggested that strength
training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance by
storing more water in the muscle.

* _Number of sets:_ someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training
is better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference
of chest and thigh).

* _Resting period between sets_: [somejrnl]
suggests that optimum resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength
training, 30-90secs for hypertrophy or endurance.
