<em>muscle stimulation period</em> - some site (forgot) suggested that the
growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.
but not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
strength, hypertrophy, etc?  gotta search this..

<em>strength vs. hypertrophy</em> - someone (on utube) suggested that strength
training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance by
storing more water in the muscle.

<em>number of sets</em> - someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training
is better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference
of chest and thigh).

<em>resting period between sets</em> - <a

suggests that optimum resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength
training, 30-90secs for hypertrophy or endurance.
