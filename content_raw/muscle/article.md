# how muscle works

Below is a summary of what I have found so far:

* _Muscle stimulation period:_ Some site (forgot) suggested that the
  growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.

  But not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
  strength, hypertrophy, etc?  Gotta search this..  Someone in YouTube said 48
  hours (WTF?).  Also [somesite:some site] says 48-72 hours.

* _Strength vs. Hypertrophy:_ Someone (on utube) suggested that strength
  training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance
  by storing more water in the muscle.

* _Number of reps:_ Some paper (forgot where) suggested that 5 reps to failure
  is good for strength gain, 15 is for puff, 20+ is for endurance.

* _Number of sets:_ Someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training is
  better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference of
  chest and thigh).

* _Resting period between sets_: [somejrnl:Some journal] suggests that optimum
  resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength training, 30-90secs for
  hypertrophy or endurance.

* _Extra squeeze_: [squeeze:This video] reports a study from 2018 that shows
  squeezing the biceps (they call it mind-muscle connection) allows for 12.4%
  muscle growth, while the normal (just lifting weights) gives 6.9%.

* _Motion range_: [squeeze:This video] says that full range of motion is good,
  and what's better is to even use the opposite muscle to further extend the
  range.  E.g. in biceps curls squeeze the triceps to further extend the
  opening range.

* _Isolated forearm_: [forearm:This video] reports studies saying that
  targeting the forearm is better.  It suggests these:

  * Curl fingers inwards to close the fist, then continue curling the fist in
    the same inwards direction.
  * Curl fingers outwards to open the fist, then continue curling the fist in
    the same outwards direction.
  * Sideways tilt of the fist.
  * Pronated Hammer curl (palm facing down).
