# how muscle works

Below is a summary of what I have found so far:

* _Muscle stimulation period:_ Some site (forgot) suggested that the
  growth-stimulating effect starts hours after a workout, and lasts 24 hours.

  But not sure, what's the optimum resting period between workout days for
  strength, hypertrophy, etc?  Gotta search this..  Someone in YouTube said 48
  hours (WTF?).  Also [somesite:some site] says 48-72 hours.

* _Strength vs. Hypertrophy:_ Someone (on utube) suggested that strength
  training creates more muscle, while hypertrophy enlarges muscle's appearance
  by storing more water in the muscle.

* _Number of sets:_ Someone (forgot where) suggested that 3 sets training is
  better than 1 for strength (maximum 1 repetition), and size (circumference of
  chest and thigh).

* _Resting period between sets_: [somejrnl:Some journal] suggests that optimum
  resting period between sets is: 2-5mins for strength training, 30-90secs for
  hypertrophy or endurance.
