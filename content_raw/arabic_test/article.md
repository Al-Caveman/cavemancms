text:سَلْ عَالِياتَ رِمِاحٍ عِنْ مَعَالِينَا، وَاسْتَشْهِدْبِهِنَّ: أَخَابَ رَجَاءٌ بِنَا؟  بِيضَاً كَانَتْ
صَنَائِعَنَا! وَبِيضَاً كَانَتْ وَقَائِعَنَا! وَزَانَتْ دِيَارًا بِأَيْدِيْنَا! فَظَنَنَّا أَنَّ العِزَّةَ كَانَتْ
مِنَّا، فَرَكَنَّا إِلَى دُنْيًا جَعَلْنَاهَا أَكْبَرَ هَمِّنَا، فَأَبْدَلَنَا رَبُّنَا بِقَوْمٍ غَيْرَنَا...

text:Ask some tall spears about our heights: was any hope disappointed in
us?  White were our works! And white were our actions! And some homes were
flourished by our hands!  Then we thought that the glory was from us, so we
settled to a lowly life that we made it to be our biggest concern, and then
our Lord replaced us by other people...

#arabic_test arabic text test

This tests:

* How Arabic looks like in [cavemancms].
* My attempt at rewriting a famous poem by the famous poet
  [safiyyuddeen][:IMO he is a lame dude, all he did was just to sit on a**
  to write some text called _poems_.  What is a poem anyway?  Can we
  compile it into an app?  Nope.  Anyway his poem was wrong.].  Basically I
  think he was a bit delusional, arrogant and sort of out of touch with
  reality.  So I think this rewrite is better.

Anyway, here we go:
