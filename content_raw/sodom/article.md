#sodom sodom and gomorrah


They mainly only had an I/O problem as they kept plugging output devices into
other output devices.

But they were pretty real people, in a sense that they didn't chop their balls
to make fake vags, nor that they wore pants with fake pockets, or shirts with
fake zippers.

Compared to today's standards[:As per 29th of October, 2018], they were pretty
conservative faggots.  But, still, [sodompunish] happened to them.

IMO today's [trashppl:trash people] are far worse than Sodom and Gamorrah.
