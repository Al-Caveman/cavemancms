try to adjust the width of the browser's window, or adjust the text size.  u'll
notice that the text will be distributed in columns, automatically, to maximize
screen's utility.  most websites don't do this, unfortunately..

this is a demonstration of a website whose content gets distributed in multiple
columns, depending on the width of the browser window, just like news papers.
the goal is to make sure that a column is never too wide, nor screen space is.
imo this is the best idea for maximizing screen's utility.

much like how news papers make efficient use of their wide papers by using
multiple columns (instead of too wide lines of texts, or wasting paper sides).
but unfortunately many websites, today, don't rspect our wide screens, and
rather opt to waste side pixels.
