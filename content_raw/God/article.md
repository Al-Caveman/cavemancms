text:     :A project $p$, that is founded by founders in $\mathcal{F}$, is said
           to be "very long-term'' if, and only if, $p$ is expected to be
           profitable only after the death of the founders in $\mathcal{F}$.

text   :The probability of having person $x$ found a very long-term project $p$
        is higher when person $x$ believes in a fair God, than the alternative
        case when $x$ is Godless.

     does not mean that God is unreal.  It just means that even an atheist
     should find a reason to appreciate believe in God---unless he is suicidal

## [god_extends_optimization_scope]'s proof

IMO if a person doesn't believe in God, then ---logically speaking--- his
_brain_ has no reason to justify investing effort in any long-term project that
will only profit after person's death.  His _brain_ will only accept investing
in projects that will be profitable during his lifespan.

The only way to get your _brain_ to accept that investing in such long-term
projects is a good idea, is to have some kind of punishments/rewards system
that will apply to you after your death---AKA a fair God.

There you go:  on advantage of believing in a fair God is that it makes your
_brain_ accept investing in long-term projects that would benefit humanity in
the long run, even though you might be alive to see that day.

The only way a Godless person can do that is by having his _feelings_ push him
to care about past his death (but not his _brain_).  Worse, such _feelings_
would always face resistance from the _brain_.

But, a Godly person would have his _brain_ and _feelings_ in agreement about
investments in positive long-term projects that benefit humanity, because the
believe in the fair God implies a fair reward even after one's death.
