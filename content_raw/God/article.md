#God_extends_optimization_scope God extends our optimization scope

Imagine a person that does not believe in God, afterlife punishments, nor
rewards.  Why would such a person's _brain_ conclude to invest in a project
that its outcomes would benefit people only after well after his death?  Why
shouldn't he, instead, spend his money to simpler projects where he will enjoy
the gains within his lifespan of, say, $80$ years?

If the person believes in no God or afterlife judgements, he will _always_ be
in a conflict between his feelings and his brain: 

* Depending on how lovely the person is, his feelings _may_ push him to be nice
  to future humans in order to be remembered.
* Regardless of how nice he is, his brain _will always_ tell him that this is
  stupid and makes no sense.  The brain is also right.  There is no logical
  reason to invest your hard-earned money in something that you won't enjoy in
  your lifespan.  Why care about life after your death?

IMO, the fact that this conflict exists in a Godless world, the expected number
of cases where an individual may act to perform actions that are useful for
humans in the long run, will decrease---let's call this: _increased expected
crab mentality rate_.

The increased crab mentality rate is obviously bad, because in the space of
possible actions that can maximize humanity's survivability, lies actions that
their gains can be manifested only in the very long run past the lifespan of a
single human.  Therefore it's a pity to live in a culture where humans have
reduced incentives to invest in such long-term projects.

IMO the solution is to believing in a fair God.  Only then the brain will find
reasons to justify investments in long-term projects that benefit humanity.
This way, both feelings and logical thinking are agreeing to help humanity
maximize its survivability; since a fair God would appreciate such good deeds.

Therefore, IMO, an honest atheist should at least appreciate that believe in
religions with _fair powerful Gods_ is good, and that such religions exist
because of our brain's attempt to maximize its survivability as a specie.

     does not mean that God is unreal.  It just means that even an atheist
     should find a reason to appreciate believe in God---unless he is suicidal
     and doesn't care about humanity's survivability.
