# cavemancms soon!

CMS = content management system.  E.g. thing that manages content in you blog,
or site.  But they all suck.  So I am making the best CMS ever.  It's called
_CavemanCMS_.

Usually, existing CMS that are dynamic, e.g. those that allow you to post, and
your users to reply in somewhat real time, require you to run a dynamic web
server.  E.g. maybe FastCGI with PHP/Python, etc.  Of course, right?

But here is the magic:  with CavemanCMS, you shall have a fully dynamic CMS,
yet your website remains fully static.  You shall upload all you want, yet your
web server will not even need to support anything other than GET requests.

And it shall also be blazing fast.  Stay tuned.  This shit is awesome.  God
willing will make some noise.  Trust.
