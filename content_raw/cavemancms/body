cms = content management system.  e.g. thing that manages content in ur blog,
or site.  but they all suck.  so i am making the best cms ever.  its called
<em>CavemanCMS</em>.

usually, existing cms that r dynamic, e.g. those that allow u to post, and ur
users to reply in somewhat real time, require u to run a dynamic web server.
e.g. maybe fastcgi with php/python, etc.  of course, right?

but here is the magic:  with CavemanCMS, u shall have a fully dynamic cms, yet
ur website remains fully static.  you shall upload all u want, yet ur web
server will not even need to support anything other than GET requests.

and it shall also be blazing fast.  stay tuned.  this shit is awesome.  God
willing will make some noise.  trust.
