# CaveMark Is Out!

CavemanCMS, and all articles in this website, currently use [cavemark] as their
markdown parser.  Neat \(\LaTeX\)-like formatting with little effort!

CaveMark is nice because it follows typesetting principles.  It's also the
fastest pure-Python markdown parser around[neat].  It easily beats [mistune] in
CPython3:

```mistune : 13.928859449 seconds
cavemark: 5.57010197 seconds (2.5 times faster!)```

and in PyPy3:

```mistune : 10.141159687 seconds
cavemark: 1.728199896 seconds (5.9 times faster!)```
