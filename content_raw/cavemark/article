text:For a Python module, speed, by itself, is not a major criterion in my
view.  But, I think it reflects how carefully CaveMark is developed.

# CaveMark is Out!

CavemanCMS, and all articles in this website, currently use [cavemark] as their
markdown parser.  Neat \(\LaTeX\)-like formatting with little effort!

CaveMark is nice because it:

+ Follows typesetting principles.
+ Is the
fastest[clarifyspeed] pure-Python markdown parser around.  It easily beats
[mistune] in CPython3:

 ```mistune : 18.177862088 seconds
cavemark: 9.386662586 seconds (1.9 times faster!)```

 in CPython2:

 ```mistune : 19.7261228561 seconds
cavemark: 9.48487520218 seconds (2.1 times faster!)```

 in PyPy3:

 ```mistune : 12.311563448000001 seconds
cavemark: 3.1916073270000003 seconds (3.9 times faster!)```

 an in PyPy3:

 ```mistune : 8.99331712723 seconds
cavemark: 1.47040700912 seconds (6.1 times faster!)```
