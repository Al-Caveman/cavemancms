text:For a Python module, speed, by itself, is not a major criteria in my view.
But, I think it reflects how carefully CaveMark is developed.

# CaveMark Is Out!

CavemanCMS, and all articles in this website, currently use [cavemark] as their
markdown parser.  Neat \(\LaTeX\)-like formatting with little effort!

CaveMark is nice because it:

+ Follows typesetting principles.
+ Is the
fastest[clarifyspeed] pure-Python markdown parser around.  It easily beats
[mistune] in CPython3:

 ```mistune : 13.928859449 seconds
cavemark: 5.57010197 seconds (2.5 times faster!)```

 and in PyPy3:

 ```mistune : 10.141159687 seconds
cavemark: 1.728199896 seconds (5.9 times faster!)```
