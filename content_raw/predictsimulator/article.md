# how is the simulator?

As you might have already heard, [maybesimulator] right now.  In this column I
describe a test that lays the foundation for a principled approach to estimate
properties about the parent existence that is simulating us!

The shit herein is _pretty dope_ and opens new gates to a whole new class of
observatories.  If you think that the [ligo] was _freaking_ cool, then my shit
herein is _OMG mega freaking dope cool_ cool.

## how many nested simulations?

IMO, our universe ($e_0$) could be simulated in a parent universe ($e_{-1}$),
and latter could be itself simulated in a grand parent universe ($e_{-2}$),
etc, until we reach the grand daddy of them all $e_{-m}$ (unless $m=\infty$,
then we will never reach the grand daddy).

Is the ancient concept of a multi-layered skies, or worlds, related to this
concept of nested simulations?  [7skies] shows an example of such ancient
imaginations that might suggest that $m=-7$.

## what to know about $e_{-1}$?

IMO, universes that end up simulating other universes, probably must be sharing
something common between them.  After all, they are the universes that ended up
simulating others.

So, IMO, if we:

+ Simulate many universes (e.g. $e_{+1}, e_{+2}, \ldots$), each initialized
  with randomized physics laws.  So each universe seems independent from each
  other, and our universe.
+ Wait to see which ones end up simulating other universes.
+ Look at those that are simulating other universes, and see if they share
  unique patterns that non-simulating universes lack.

I mean, imagine if almost all universes that we simulate, that themselves end
up simulating others, share some common properties that is only unique among
them (but not among universes that don't simulate other universes), won't you
then feel that our parent universe is probably more likely to also have those
properties?  After all it is also one that has simulated another universe (our
universe).

## limitations

We probably can't simulate a rat's ass these days, so all this is wishful
thinking that, one day, when computers are powerful enough, we might have
better guesses about how might our parent universe be.

But there is certain amount of badass-ness that our universe can't simulate.
E.g. our universe can't simulate a universe that can solve problems that are
not solvable by Turing machines.

But, still, if we do these simulations, we can possibly end up updating our
probability model about our parent universe's properties.  Currently, we know
nothing.  But after those simulations, maybe we could say "_welp.. probably it
has X!_''.
