#blindfolded_faggot_thought_experiment the blindfolded faggot thought
experiment

This is a thought experiment to investigate what makes a faggot, a faggot.
Consider the following:

+ _Group 1_ --- A blindfoldeded faggot is given a woman's butt, but the faggot
  is lied to that the butt is a man's.  He then f\*\*\*s the butt, then rates
  it from 1 to 5 (1 is bad, 5 is good).

+ _Group 2_ --- Same, but the faggot is told the truth that it's a female's
  butt.

Imagine that we randomly sample 100 faggots from Amsterdam's faggot pride
rally, and randomly assign 50 of them to _Group 1_ and the other 50 to _Group
2_ --- what do you think will happen?

On average, _I bet_ this will happen:

* Faggots of _Group 1_ would say "_OMG BEST MALE BUTT EVER 5/5!!_''.
* Faggots of _Group 2_ would say "_No.  0/5.  Can't even have an erection.  We
  are born faggots don't you know?_''.

You probably agree.  Because, _I guess_, a male's anus is the same as a
female's.  Or, if you are too skeptic, you may at least agree that a female's
anus is like, say, a 10 years old boy's anus[:I'm just guessing.  I never tried
any.  IMO it's easy to simulate anuses given their simplicity since they are
merely some elastic holes.  IMO You don't need to actually put your junk in
anuses to discover that they are elastic holes.]?  This probably also explains
why faggots are often crypto pedos.

Here is what I think the thought experiment implies:

+ Technically, _in the thought experiment_, the faggot is fucking the anus, not
  the butt, not the legs, not the face with shaved beard, etc.
+ The reason a faggot appreciates an anus that's attached to a man's butt, over
  another that's attached to a female's butt, is because of the _context_
  around the anus.  E.g. man's anus has the context that it is attached to a
  hairy man's ass that's attached to a face with shaved beard.
+ Such context information is a very high-level information.
+ High-level context-information is IMO processed by the brain.
+ IMO neural activity about context information is by far mostly influenced by
  the past memory, or environment, than (say) genes.
+ Therefore, the primary contributor in the making of a faggot is the
  environment, and not the genes (genes might be only a marginal/secondary
  cause).
