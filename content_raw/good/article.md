# what is _good_?

When people debate, they often say things like: $x$ is good, $y$ is not
good, why is $z$ good? Etc.  Yet rarely ever they discuss the fundamental
question: what is _good_ itself? Based on what criteria a thing becomes good?

It is logically impossible for two people to _meaningfully_ debate whether
$x$ is good, while them having different definitions of _good_.  If they ever
conclude something correctly, it must be thanks to the amount of sheer dumb
luck that accidentally served them.  As a result, $99.99\%$[assnumber] of all
debates are useless and cyclic.

To cut the chase short, here is what I think is the _best_ definition of
_good_:

[!defgood]

[defgood] has these nice properties:

  * It can be _objectively_ measured!  We can use statistics, biology, etc, to
    measure expected values of how _good_ a thing is!
  * All other definitions of _good_ are all dependant on _survivability
    maximization_.

You don't believe me?  Let's look at other definitions:

[!pplgood1]

The _common sense_ that is proposed in [pplgood1] depends on the biological
configuration of the people that their _common sense_ is analyzed.  The
biological configuration, _itself_, is a function of _evolution_.  As you know,
evolution makes use of _natural selection_, which rewards patterns that have
higher survivability.

I know evolution itself is not a confirmed fact, but a mere guess.  But come on
dude.. it's the best guess we have now.  Do you have any better guess?

Therefore, IMO it's fair to say that common sense _itself_ is nothing but a
mere parameter that is tweaked by evolution to achieve a higher survivability
maximization of the species at hand (in this case humans).  See! It came back
to [defgood]!

[!pplgood2]

[pplgood2] has the same inadequacy problem that [pplgood1] suffers.
Eventually, the _happiness_ feeling, itself, is also a mere parameter that was
tweaked throught the ages, due to evolution, in order to allow mankind to
survive better.  As you can see, happiness itself seems to be a _proxy_ that
reflects survivability maximization.  Again.. back to [defgood]!

[!pplgood3]

[pplgood3] is possibly true,  but, we can't measure/test souls/spirits, or
things beyong the measurable world.  Therefore, while [pplgood3] might be true,
we can't use it to verify any hypotheses.  As a result, I suggest that it is
perhaps better to not define _good_ based on it.

So.. this leaves us with [defgood] as the the most general/basic measurable
definition so far.  What do you think?  Can you find any better definition than
[defgood]?
