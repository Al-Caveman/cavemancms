gnu/rms pushed towards freeing software, but not free enough.  the Ggpl3.0
addresses a key limitation in <a
href='https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html'>gpl3.0</a>.

basically, gpl3.0 ensures that the software remains free, but it ignoves the
fact that software could be used to push humanity towards extinction.  in such
a case, what use would free software make if there r no humanies to use it?

the Ggpl3.0 effectively prefixes gpl3.0 by the <a
href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments'>ten commandments</a>, so
that u r not allowed to use a Ggpl3.0-licensed software in anything that
violates the ten commandments.

this means u won't be allowed to use Ggpl3.0-licensed stuff to, say, run an
adultery website, operate an abortion clinic, dishonour ur daddy, etc.

this is bcoz the stuff banned in the ten commandments seem result in higher
divorce rate, higher std, lower birth rate, etc; generally humanity's
extinction.  stats also seem to suggest this.  so, unless u want to have a
world with free code but no humans -to use the code-, u need to adopt the
Ggpl3.0 license.
