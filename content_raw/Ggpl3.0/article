# Godly General Public License v3 (GGPLv3)

GNU/RMS pushed towards freeing software, but not free enough.  The GGPL3.0
addresses a key limitation in [gplv3].

Basically, GPLv3 ensures that the software remains free, but it ignores the
fact that software could be used to push humanity towards extinction.  In such
a case, what use would free software make if there are no humans to use it?

The GGPLv3 effectively prefixes GPLv3 by [10cmds].  This means you won't be
allowed to use GGPLv3-licensed stuff to, say, run a fornication website,
operate an abortion clinic, dishonour your father,
etc.

[!10cmdsimg]

This is nice, because the things banned in [10cmds] seem to result in higher
divorce rate, higher std, lower birth rate, etc; generally humanity's
extinction.  Stats also seem to suggest this.  So, unless you want to have a
world with free code but no humans -to use the code-, your need to adopt the
GGPLv3 license.
