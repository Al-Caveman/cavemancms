#dukkha_workout_routine the dukkha routine

I propose to you the _Dukkha workout routine_.  Each workout is a single set,
sot he whole thing takes only 10 to 15 minutes maximum.

## tools needed:

* 1 dumbbell.
* Something horizontal to hang on to do pull-ups.
* 2 circular ropes to hang on the pull-up to do the suspension dips.

## time needed

* 10 to 15 minutes maximum.

## the routine

* Pull-ups.
* Suspension dips.
* Suspension leg lift (for abs).
* Side moving planks for abs (10 for each side).
* Biceps curls.
* Shoulder press (10 for each shoulder).
* Triceps curls.
* Chest-pull.
* Single-legged squad (10 for each leg).
* Calf raise (10 for each leg).

## repetition

The repetition of each workout item in the routine should be maximum possible
(to failure), given the following constraint:  _must not exceed 10_.  Ideally,
aim for 5 as the max (if you have enough weight around to achieve that).

If you find yourself able to exceed 10, then add extra weights so that you end
up failing no later than the 10th repetition.  E.g. if you can do more than 10
pull-ups, then hold a dumbbell with your legs so that you fail by the 10th
repetition.
