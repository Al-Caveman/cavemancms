#dukkha_workout_routine the [dukkha:Dukkha] routine

I propose to you the _[dukkha:Dukkha] workout routine_ --- a workout routine
tailored specifically for the needs of the modern man of the $21^{st}$ century.

## advantages

* Can be done in many places as it requires very few tools.
* Can be done by busy people as it requires only 10 to 15 minutes.
* Covers most of your muscles, and leads proportional muscle growth.  In about
  a month of following this routine, my cold-flexed biceps got bigger by 1
  inch --- This Shit Works(tm).

## resources needed

* 1 dumbbell.
* Something horizontal to hang on to do pull-ups.
* 2 circular ropes to hang on the horizontal thing to do the suspension dips.
* 10 to 15 minutes max.

## the routine

* Pull-ups.
* Chin-ups.
* Forward-leaning Suspension dips.
* Straight-up Suspension dips.
* Suspension leg lift, up till your torso also curls (not only leg lift).
* Side moving planks.
* Single-legged squad, with full leg extension up to a point where you also
  extend your feet (i.e. single-legged standing calf raise).
* Shoulder press.
* Chest-pull.

## repetition

The repetition of each workout item in the routine should be maximum possible
(to failure), given the following constraint:  _must not exceed 10_.  Ideally,
aim for 5 as the max (if you have enough weight around to achieve that).

If you find yourself able to exceed 10, then add extra weights so that you end
up failing no later than the 10th repetition.  E.g. if you can do more than 10
pull-ups, then hold a dumbbell with your legs so that you fail by the 10th
repetition.

## daily nutrition

* 1 serving of multi-vitamin pills.  Let's get real, most of us don't have much
  time to eat diverse-enough set of fruits.
* An amount of proteins as suggested by the [tdeecalculator:TDEE Calculator],
  given the constraint that the total calories does not exceed what's also
  suggested by [tdeecalculator:it].
* Drink a good amount of water.
