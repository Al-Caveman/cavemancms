#dukkha_workout_routine the [dukkha] routine

I propose to you the _[dukkha] workout routine_.  Each workout is a single set,
sot he whole thing takes only 10 to 15 minutes maximum.

Why does this routine's name contain the word [dukkha]?  Because it's 10
minutes, per day, worth of suffering.  The suffering only lasts 10 to 15
minutes a day.  Every day, before you start, you _must_ say this "_it's gonna
hurt_''.

## advantages

* Covers most of your muscles, and leads proportional muscle growth.
* Can be done in many places as it requires very few tools.
* Can be done by busy people as it requires only 10 to 15 minutes..

## resources needed

* 1 dumbbell.
* Something horizontal to hang on to do pull-ups.
* 2 circular ropes to hang on the horizontal thing to do the suspension dips.
* 10 to 15 minutes max.

## the routine

* Pull-ups.
* Suspension dips.
* Suspension leg lift (for abs).
* Side moving planks for abs (10 for each side).
* Biceps curls.
* Shoulder press (10 for each shoulder).
* Triceps curls.
* Chest-pull.
* Single-legged squad (10 for each leg).
* Calf raise (10 for each leg).

## repetition

The repetition of each workout item in the routine should be maximum possible
(to failure), given the following constraint:  _must not exceed 10_.  Ideally,
aim for 5 as the max (if you have enough weight around to achieve that).

If you find yourself able to exceed 10, then add extra weights so that you end
up failing no later than the 10th repetition.  E.g. if you can do more than 10
pull-ups, then hold a dumbbell with your legs so that you fail by the 10th
repetition.

## daily nutrition

* 1 serving of multi-vitamin pills.  Let's get real, most of us don't have much
  time to eat diverse-enough set of fruits.
* An amount of proteins as suggested by the [tdeecalculator], given the
  constraint that the total calories does not exceed what's suggested by the
  [tdeecalculator].
* Drink a good amount of water.
