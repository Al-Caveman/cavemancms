## thoughts on [p1]

If the storage is causing no harm on the suspect, then the suspect could be
stored indefinitely.  This implies things like, a very comfortable storage with
nice bed, food, no harm on income, no harm on psychology, no mixing with bad
people that may corrupt him, etc.

But usually the storage does cause some harm (e.g. shit bed, mixing with shit
people, etc).  Thus, [p1] is only good if the expected harm with the free
suspect is more than the expected harm with the stored suspect, which depends on:

* How slow the court is to finally figure out shit.
* How likely the suspect is to run away if he is not stored.
* How much loss would happen if the suspect runs away (e.g. how much money gets
  permanently lost).
* How much suffering will the suspect endure by being stored; depends on how
  shit the place is.
* ...

Generally, I think there is a lot of room in reality of making [p1] a good tool
in a legal system if the storage is not for too long, and the storage is not
too harmful on the suspect.


## thoughts on [p2]

[p2] is basically a synonym to the naturally occurring concept known as
_"parent''_:

* _If the bad person is a child_ --- then he should be parented by his biological
  parents, or relatives.  Evolution has already made parents, and family
  members, evolve to be good trainers of their children, but a government is
  not evolved as much as them.  Therefore, resorting to use a government
  facility as a parenting facility is suboptimal, and we better use what
  billions of years of evolution has given us:  biological parents or
  relatives.

  Involving the government to offer parenting services goes under
  micromanagement, ends up wasting too much money, opens the door for a corrupt
  government to raise such bad people as good voters for them, and lack enough
  personal touch in fixing the bad people.

* _If the bad person is an adult_ --- then it means that the time of parenting
  is gone.  In such case, you better give up on parenting, and look for other
  things.

  Practically, when governments store bad people in prisons, with the claim of
  making them better people, they often make them into worse people, as they
  mix up with possibly worse people in the prison.

So those who claim that _prisons_ are as per [p2], they are indirectly saying
that prisons are bad.


## thoughts on [p3]

Let's look at the extreme ends of punishment by storage:

* _The most peaceful form of storage_ ---  a comfortable hotel.  In such case, it's
  a pure waste of money.
* _The most painful form of storage_ --- either (depending on country):

    * A solitary confinement:  so much money is spent on feeding the bad doer,
      electricity, building maintenance, and guard salaries.
    * An imprisonment with a bunch of horrible gangs:  so much money is wasted,
      plus the imprisoned people turned into worse people (possibly also with
      herpes).

On the bright side, [p3] can have a deterring effect via _fear_, as it may
cause the good people feel that becoming bad people is a bad idea.

But, there are cheaper ways of achieving _fear_ and deterrence of good people
from becoming bad, that does not have the side effects of [p3], such as:

* Monetary fines.
* Firing from job.
* Lashing/flocking.
* Execution.
* ...

Such methods hardly cost any money (i.e. no money to spend on food, building
maintenance, guards salaries, etc), and hardly has any effect of mixing bad
people with worse people (and hence less chance of corrupting people beyond
their corruption).

So, [p3] is surely a bad idea, as there are equally effective methods that are
cheaper with less side effects.


## thoughts on [p4]

A [gulag:Gulag] is basically a forced labour camp, with huge negative emotional
thoughts around it due to Stalin.  But ---philosophically---  what is a forced
labour camp?  Is _"capitalism''_ a huge forced labour camp?  Is _life_ a forced
labour camp?

See, it's fundamentally a more complex problem.  Just because Stalin abused the
concept, and showed us that it can be bad, it does not mean that the concept
itself is fundamentally bad.  We just need to have a deeper look right now.

What if someone shits on streets, or on someone's property?  IMO it's fair to
have the law enforcement force him clean the streets and the properties.  Is it
forced labour?  Yes.  Is it a form of Gulag?  Yes.  Is it bad?  No.  It seems a
great disciplinary action to fairly punish the bad doer in kind.

For the vast majority of cases, we don't need forced labour camps, as
capitalism and the monetary system functions as a huge Gulag (which is good).
Hence, often paying monetary fees to compensate for damage caused by bad doers
is a good idea, and is practically a good form Gulag.

My thoughts are:

* Stalin-style Gulag is very bad.
* Making people who shit in streets, to clean the streets, is a good kind of
  Gulag.

## thoughts on [p5]

Since [p5] is a mixture of [p1], [p2], [p3] and [p4], my thoughts on it is also
a mixture of what's in [thoughts_on_prisons.2], [thoughts_on_prisons.3],
[thoughts_on_prisons.4] and [thoughts_on_prisons.5].


## summary

These are good:

* Storing high-risk suspects, comfortably in isolation, until the court figures
  out the verdict.
* Making people, who shit in streets, clean the streets.


These are bad:

* Punishing people by storing them, as it is too expensive.
* Parenting people by storing them, as it's micromanagement and a redundant
  concept to _biological parents or relatives_, except that governments are not
  evolved to be good at it.

The better alternatives to the bad ones are:


* Forgiveness as a choice to victims in case they just feel so.  Sometimes
  forgiveness does better to a society, and giving this tool to victims allows
  them to act dynamically according to the current situation that they live in.

* Instead of punishment-by-storage, cheaper punishments should be used, such as
  monetary fines, termination from job, flocking, lashing, exile, capital
  punishment, etc.
   
  IMO capital punishment is even more humane than life-time sentence as the
  latter amounts as 20 years of torture (i.e. beating/raping by gang members
  in prisons).
