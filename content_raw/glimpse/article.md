#insulty_app_names insulty app names

_Synopsys---_Some SJWs forked a FOSS software, only to rename it, because they
thought former name was offensive to them.  But when I did the same, by forking
yet another software that I thought its name was offensive, they called my work
_"a joke''_.  Then, they freaked, and deleted all traces of this conversation
(which happened on their Github issues page).  But, very fortunately, this
conversation [archivedissue:got archived] by some very brave Internet heroes,
so that this event will be in history for generations to come!

## background

As you might have [news:heard], some [tranny:trannies] and [homo:faggots]
forked [gimp:GIMP] because they thought _GIMP_ was an offensive name to them,
and called it [glimpseeditor:Glimpse], instead.  So that, hopefully, they can
finally use GIMP at school, without getting bullied by students and teachers.

So, I thought, why not?  I ---too--- know a software that its name sounds like
an insult.  Henceforth, I forked [qutebrowser:Qutebrowser] into
[glimpsebrowser:Glimpsebrowser], because IMO the Q-word sounds like an insult
to me.

## glimpse software foundation

But why stop there?  Why not extend this Glimpsetardian movement into the
_Glimpse Software Foundation_, where SJWs unite in power to rename all software
with bad names?  We got a few:

* GIMP into Glimpse editor _---accomplished_.
* Git into Glimpse version control system.
* Qutebrowser into Glimpse image editor _---accomplished_.

So I filed an Issue in the Glimpse editor Github page, and this happened:

+ I proposed the Glimpse Software Foundation.
+ A [homo:faggot] closed the issue, and said that what I am doing is a joke.
+ I asked, why?  I did _exactly_ what you did.  Yet you say it is a joke?
+ A Glimpsetard locked the issue, then after a while, also _deleted_ it
  entirely (I guess because it revealed that _even they_ know that what they
  are doing is _a joke_.

Fortunately, a legendary Internet hero got all this archived, and can be found
[archivedissue:here].

## deeper analysis

I'm confused.  I thought that trannies and faggots are cool with immoralities,
as they reportedly flash their dicks/tits in streets in front of our kids
during their gay pride marches.  But _somehow_ they just can't stand a bad
software name.  Srsly?
