u probably heard of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>.
i call it the <em>Godless</em> prisoner's dilemma for the obvious reason: it
lacks God.  this should be fair enough.

a quick reminder of the [Godless] dilemma: it says something like, 2 dudes in a
prison with these options: if one snitches, but the other doesn't, the snitcher
gets out of prison immediately, and the snitched will be there for a very long
time, like 10 years or something.  if none snitch, they will be imprisoned for
3 months.  if both snitch, then they will be imprisoned for 1 year.  or
something like this.

iirc it's shown that, in practice, under the constraints of the scenario of the
dilemma, ppl will choose to snitch against each other, thus reaching a
sub-optimal global solution.  so, they end up being imprisoned for 1 year,
instead of 3 months.

but what about the <em>Godly</em> prisoner's dilemma, where we modify it to
include the following clause:  <em>you are always being watched by a fair God,
who will reward you accordingly based on how truthful and honest you are</em>.
then suddenly we r dealing with a different problem, where the imprisoned dudes
have more incentives to just be honest, and say the truth..

i expect the Godly prisoner's dilemma to be more likely to result in a solution
that is more optimum for the greatness of the individuals, and humanity as a
whole. after all, it places more incentives to say the truth, thanks to
believing in God.
