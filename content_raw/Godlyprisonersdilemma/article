# The Godly Prisoner's Dilemma is better IMO

You have probably heard of the [prisonersdilemma].  I call it the _Godless_
prisoner's dilemma for the obvious reason: it lacks God.  this should be fair
enough.

A quick reminder of the _Godless_ dilemma: it says something like, 2 dudes in a
prison with these options: if one snitches, but the other doesn't, the snitcher
gets out of prison immediately, and the snitched will be there for a very long
time, like 10 years or something.  If none snitch, they will be imprisoned for
3 months.  If both snitch, then they will be imprisoned for 1 year.

But what about the _Godly_ prisoner's dilemma, where we modify it to include
the following clause:  _you are always being watched by a fair God, who will
reward you accordingly based on how truthful and honest you are_.  Then
suddenly we are dealing with a different problem, where the imprisoned dudes
have more incentives to just be honest, and say the truth..

I expect the Godly prisoner's dilemma to be more likely to result in a solution
that is more optimum for the greatness of the individuals, and humanity as a
whole.  After all, it places more incentives to say the truth, thanks to
believing in God.
