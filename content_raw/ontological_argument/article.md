# [godel]'s ontological argument[watiunderstood]

[godel] said [godelsaid] like this[watiunderstood]:

[!godlike]
[!godessence]
[!godexists]
[!propertyposnegation]
[!propertygodlike]
[!propertyexistence]

## [godel]'s conclusions[watiunderstood]

[!positivesconsistent]
[!godconsistent]
[!godexemplified]

## my attempt after [godel]'s footsteps

[godel] didn't define what's positive.  I dunno why.  IMO it's easy to show
what's _positive_ by linking it to _good_ as I did earlier[detailselsewhere]:

footnote:detailselsewhere
text    :Details is already posted in another column.  Plz read that if you
         don't believe me; maybe it will help.

definition:positive
text      :A property $b$ is positive if it's good for $x$.

definition:good
text      :A property $b$ is good for $x$ if helps maximizing $x$'s
           survivability[detailselsewhere].

[!positive][!good]

Welp... by [godlike], [positive] and [good], God exists by, welp, definition.
Since survivability _is_ existence ---  Q.E.D.

So, as you see, [godel]'s path is kinda boring.  The moment he _defines_ God to
be all-positive, is the moment he defines God to exist.  So all that dance that
[godel] did is kinda weasely IMO.
