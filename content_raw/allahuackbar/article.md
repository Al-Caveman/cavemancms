#allahu_ackbar allahu ackbar

"_Allahu ackbar_'' --- is something about to blow up?  [truckofpeace:Truck of
peace] again?  More on this later.  But for now, what does it mean?

[!allahuackbar]

## meaning

* The trailing _u_ in _Allahu_ is only a vowel that serves a grammatical
  purpose.  The noun is _Allah_ --- _الله_ in Arabic without the _u_-sounding
  vowel, _اللهُ_ with the the vowel.

  _Allah_ is literally _God_ in Arabic, with the capital letter _G_.  Is it
  only Muslims' God?  Certainly not.

  Allah is also used by Arab Christians.  In fact, _Allah_ is in the Arabic
  translation of the Bible whenever God is referred as shown in
  [quotearabgenesis].

  [quotearabgenesis]'s translation in English is:

  [!quoteengenesis]

  You can use a translator to verify that _الله_ is referring to _God_.

* _Ackbar_ just means _greater_.

So the string _Allahu ackbar_ means _God is greater_, which ---perhaps--- you
knew.  But IMO you didn't know that _Allah_ is literally the name of the same
Biblical God that Arab Christians use.

So, before you say that _Allah = Satan_, put in your mind that this also refers
to the God of Arab christians as well.

## usage and function

Usage --- IMO usually if someone is facing hardship, the person reminds himself
that God is greater \[than the cause of the hardship\], so that he
perseveres[:Perseverance is by not sinning and remaining submissive to God's
order.] and hopefully wins the greater reward: success now, heavens later, or
both.

Function --- IMO offers the believer psychological support to allow him to
contain himself better at times of hardship, without needing to drink
alcohol[:Alcohol is a depressant that kills 3 million people every year,
directly, and others indirectly as it damages brain's function.].

quotation:genesis96
text     :Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
          the image of God made he man.
author   :Genesis 9:6, [linkgenesisdeathpenalty:KJV]

quotation:quranmurder
text     :And whoever is killed unjustly, We have (already) appointed to his
          patron authority. So let him not exceed (Literally: be extravagant)
          in killing; surely he will be vindicated.
author   :Quran 17:33, [linkqurandeathpenalty:Dr. Ghali's translation]

Those behind [911:9/11], [detruck:Berlin's truck attack], etc, are murderers
and as per God's order, both Quranically and Biblically, should get the capital
punishment:

[!quranmurder]
[!genesis96]

Some may pick on the word _unjustly_ in [quranmurder], but IMO  no key Islamic
scholar ever called murder of civilian innocents, regardless of faith, justice,
including the grand Mufti of Saudi.  In fact, all of the key scholars agree
that their kill is murder and unjust.

What about the name _ISIS = Islamic State ... something_?  IMO, obviously, name
itself doesn't imply function.  E.g. I can call an apple a banana instead, but
it won't become a banana.  So, IMO, if ISIS violates Islamic rules, but calls
itself Islamic, then IMO this rather make them liars.
