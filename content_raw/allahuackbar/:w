#allahu_ackbar allahu ackbar

"_Allahu ackbar_'' --- is something about to blow up?  [truckofpeace:Truck of
peace] again?  --- more on this later.  But for now, what does it mean?

[!allahuackbar]

## meaning

* The trailing _u_ in Allah_u_ is only a vowel that serves a grammatical
  purpose.  The noun is _Allah_.

  _Allah_ is literally _God_ in Arabic (with the capital letter _G_).  Is
  it only Muslims' God?  Certainly no!  Allah is also used by Arab Christians.
  In fact, _Allah_ is in the Arabic translation of the Bible whenever God is
  referred.

* _Ackbar_ just means _greater_.

So the string _Allahu ackbar_ literally means _God is greater_, and it is the
very same biblical God that Arab Christians worship.

God is greater?  Than what?  Depends on the context.  IMO it's usually greater
than the cause of hardship.

## usage and function

Usage --- IMO usually if someone is facing hardship, the person reminds himself
that God is greater \[than the cause of the hardship\], so that he
perseveres[:Perseverance is by not sinning and remaining submissive to God's
order.] and hopefully wins the greater reward: success now, heavens later, or
both.

Function --- IMO offers the believer psychological support to allow him to
contain himself better at times of hardship, without needing to drink
alcohol[:Alcohol is a depressant that kills 3 million people every year,
directly, and others indirectly as it damages brain's function.].
