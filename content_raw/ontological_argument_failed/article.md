# where does the ontological argument go wrong

The argument starts by defining God as:

[!god]

This, by definition, implies that God exists, because maximal greatness implies
existence.  So, yeah, things that are defined to exist, exist.  Duh.

So a better definition is:

[!godbetter]

Now, good luck proving God's existence using [godbetter].
