# where does the ontological argument go wrong

The argument starts by defining God as:

[!god]

This, by definition, implies that God exists, because maximal greatness implies
existence.  Also, "_being_'' requires existence as far as I understand English.
So, yeah, things that are defined to exist, exist.  Duh.

So a better definition is:

[!godbetter]

Now, good luck proving God's existence using [godbetter].

_Note: this doesn't mean that ---God forbid--- God doesn't exist.  It just
means that the ontological argument is pointless.  There is still a lot of good
reasons to follow God's path.  IMO God's path is the best path to follow.
