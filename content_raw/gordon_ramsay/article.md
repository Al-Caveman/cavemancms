I invented new food, that IMO deprecates Gordon Ramsay.  See [gordon].

My new invented food:

+ Bring a thin white bread from the fridge.  No heating/cutting.
+ Spread 1 spoon salted butter on it.
+ Put several layers of smoked turkey[:Turkey the chicken-like animal, not the
  country.], or smoked beef, on it.  This is from the fridge, with no heating.
+ Put hand-full of  _uncut_ mushroom there.  Also from fridge, without cutting.
  Preferably, not even washing.
+ Put hand-full of some veggies.  Similar to mushroom, no cutting.
+ Mildly wrap similar to tacos.
+ Eat.

Pros:

+ _Close proximity---_All stuff taken from fridge.
+ _Convenient storage---_Ingredients can be kept in fridge for some time.
+ _Simple process---_No complex processing.  E.g. no heating, cutting, etc.
+ _High-protein low-carb potential---_Add more beef/chicken to increase protein content.
+ _Great taste---_Yes.

Cons:

+ Probably not a general-purpose _perfect food_ yet.
