Pros:

+ _Close proximity---_All stuff taken from fridge.
+ _Convenient storage---_Ingredients can be kept in fridge for some time.
+ _Simple process---_No complex processing.  E.g. no heating, cutting, etc.
+ _High-protein low-carb potential---_Add more beef/chicken to increase protein content.

Cons:

+ Probably not a general-purpose _perfect food_ yet.  But plz stay tuned for
  even better stuff.
