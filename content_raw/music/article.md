#imo_music_not_good imo music is not good

Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:

* That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.

That's it.  Now the next question is:

question:whyneedmusic
text    :Why do you need that information?

[!whyneedmusic]

and its answer:

answer  :studyingretards
text    :Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.

[!studyingretards]

So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!

Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:

* Weakens your ear drums.
* Induces bias to your brain's activity.

For the _drums_ damage point, evolution-wise, we are more evolved to handle
sounds found in nature, as opposed to sounds produced by musical instruments.
This may explain why music is more harmful to our ears than natural sounds.

But what do I mean by the _bias_ shit?  Basically music IMO alters how you
think.  E.g. depending on the music you listen, you may end up being more
risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not good, because it induces some
artificial bias in your brain's function as shown in [biasvariance].

IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.
