#imo_music_not_good imo music is not good

Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:

* That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.

That's it.  Now the next question is:

question:whyneedmusic
text    :Why do you need that information?

[!whyneedmusic]

and its answer:

answer  :studyingretards
text    :Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.

[!studyingretards]

So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!

Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:

* Weakens your ear drums.
* Induces bias to your brain's activity.

For the _drums_ damage point, evolution-wise, we are more evolved to handle
sounds found in nature, as opposed to sounds produced by musical instruments.
This may explain why music is more harmful to our ears than natural sounds.

But what do I mean by the _bias_ shit?  Basically music IMO alters how you
think.  E.g. depending on the music you listen, you may end up being more
risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not good, because it induces some
artificial bias in your brain's function as shown in [biasvariance].

IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.

Some people disagree with me and say that [musiciq:music can make people
smarter].  But IMO [musiciq:the study] has a fundamental flaw: the alternative
to music classes for kids were _drama lessons_ and _nothing_.  They didn't
include, say, _mathematics_ classes as an alternative.

This is why [musiciq:the study] is shit: maybe the reason the kids that learned
music became smarter was thanks to them needing to learn musical notes (those
fancy symbols for music) which functions as some kind of programming (except
for generating sound).

In other words, if the kids had taken a _programming_ class, or extra
_mathematics_ classes, then maybe they would have been even smarter, without
having the side effect of musical instruments possibly damaging their ears.

IMO it's disgusting that the study claims it's due to music that kids became
smarter, and not because of the abstract mathematical and logical aspects of
generating music, which ---itself--- is not music.

[musicwtf:This other study] says that [musiciq:that study] is shit, but then
adds its own shit by doing similar wrong shit.  One funny aspect it mentions
that music is good to calm retards.  See... I LITERALLY told you music is for
retards!
