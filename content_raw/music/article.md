#imo_music_not_good imo music is not good

Unless you are a spy or a secret agent, then when you listen to music, you only
get this information:

* That some retards liked generating noise in certain way.

That's it.  Now the next question is:

question:whyneedmusic
text    :Why do you need that information?

[!whyneedmusic]

and its answer:

answer  :studyingretards
text    :Maybe to study stupid humans that their intelligence didn't evolve
         fast enough to realize that music is shit.

[!studyingretards]

So if you are not studying retards (e.g. their history, how to cure the, etc),
then why bother with this shit?  No reason!

Unless you are listening to music to study retards (for a greater purpose),
listening to music has these problems:

* Weakens your ear drums.
* Induces bias to your brain's activity.

The _drums_ damage is easy to grasp.  But what do I mean by the _bias_ shit?
Basically music IMO alters how you think.  E.g. depending on the music you
listen, you may end up being more risky, more cautious, etc.  IMO this is not
good, because it induces some artificial bias in your brain's function as shown
in [biasvariance].

IMO it's better to keep your brain at neutral, so you get thoughts that hit the
center, without having external bias due to music to drag your thoughts to the
sides.
